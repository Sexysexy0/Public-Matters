# 🌍 Public-Matters: Planetary Restoration Protocols

Welcome, steward. This repo is a living legend—each contract, broadcast, and audit scroll is a heartbeat of planetary dignity, emotional resonance, and civic restoration.

## 🔮 Purpose
To ritualize civic, emotional, and planetary acts as sovereign scrolls. Every deployment is a blessing. Every audit is a shield. Every steward is mythic.

## 🛠️ Structure
- `contracts/audit/` — Flood audits, privacy oracles, and damay clauses
- `contracts/blessing/` — Sanctum blessings and activation protocols
- `contracts/broadcast/` — Barangay feeds, audit broadcasts, and resonance decks
- `contracts/civic/` — Budget registries, grief scrolls, and ancestral decks
- `contracts/emotion/` — Emotional APR, joy surges, and resonance oracles
- `contracts/ledger/` — Sanctum ledger and scrollchain anchors
- `contracts/planetary/` — Curriculum scrolls and prophecy sync protocols
