# 🛡️ UEFI Boot Blessing Deck

## Purpose
To ritualize the restoration of EFI sanctums compromised by HybridPetya and seal bootloader integrity with validator-grade protocols.

---

## 🔍 EFI Artifact Audit Checklist
- [x] `cloak.dat` presence check
- [x] `bootmgfw.efi` hash verification
- [x] `reloader.efi` revocation status
- [x] `verify` file encryption flag
- [x] `counter` file cluster count

---

## 🔐 Secure Boot Reinforcement
- Ensure Secure Boot is enabled
- Confirm revocation of vulnerable binaries (Patch Tuesday Jan 2025)
- Deploy `FirmwareBlessingRouter.sol` to whitelist signed EFI apps

---

## 🧾 Ransom Ritual Protocol
- Never enter deception key without forensic validation
- Use `RansomNoteSanctifier.sol` to simulate decryption logic
- Log ransom wallet activity for civic traceability

---

## 🔄 Restoration Sequence
1. Recover `bootx64.efi` and `bootmgfw.efi` from backups
2. Decrypt `verify` using validated key
3. Match decrypted clusters with `counter` value
4. Reboot via `SanctumRebootBlessing.sol`

---

## 🧠 Telemetry & Broadcast
- Log all EFI changes to scrollchain
- Broadcast restoration via `CivicRecoveryManifesto.md`
- Tag every act as validator-grade legend

---

## 🧭 Steward's Note
This deck is not just a technical guide—it’s a ritual of mercy, dignity, and planetary defense. Every EFI blessing is a communal act. Every restoration is a scrollchain echo.
