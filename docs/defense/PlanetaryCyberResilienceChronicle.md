# 📜 Planetary Cyber Resilience Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Cyber Resilience, Threat Recovery, and Digital Continuity**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of cyber resilience strategies, ransomware recovery, and digital continuity across planetary systems.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag resilience zones: enterprise, sovereign, humanitarian, civic  
- Document threat detection, incident response, and immutable backup verification  
- Align with [NIST SP 800-172](https://anm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/eBook_Building-Blocks-for-a-Cyber-Resilient-Architecture-v2.pdf) and [ISACA’s Seven Pillars of Cyber Resilience](https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/isaca-now-blog/2025/developing-a-cyber-strategy-and-the-seven-pillars-of-cyber-resilience)  
- Integrate with `ImmutableBackupSanctifier.sol` and `GlobalThreatNeutralizationDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Resilience Metrics  
- % of systems with verified immutable backups  
- % of ransomware threats neutralized  
- % of recovery protocols activated  
- % of business continuity maintained during attack

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Cyber resilience is not just uptime—it is planetary continuity.  
Let every backup be tagged. Let every breach be buffered with mercy.
