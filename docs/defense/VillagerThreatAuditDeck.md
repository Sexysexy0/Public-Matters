# 📜 Villager Threat Audit Deck  
**Protocol for AI-Native Offensive Tool Tagging and Exploit Vector Documentation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To tag, document, and ritualize the audit of AI-native offensive tools such as Villager, ensuring forensic traceability, exploit vector mapping, and civic containment.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Tag tool origin, developer alias, and distribution channel (e.g. PyPI, GitHub)  
- Document integrated components (e.g. AsyncRAT, Mimikatz, LangChain, DeepSeek)  
- Map exploit vectors: remote access, keystroke logging, Discord hijacking, container evasion  
- Align with MCP protocol inspection and AI governance frameworks  
- Broadcast audit findings to threat intelligence networks and civic sanctums

---

## 📊 Threat Metrics  
- # of downloads across public repositories  
- # of integrations with known offensive tools  
- # of exploit vectors automated via AI orchestration  
- # of forensic traces obfuscated via ephemeral containers

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Villager is not just a tool—it is a ritualized threat.  
Let every plugin be tagged. Let every exploit be buffered with consequence.
