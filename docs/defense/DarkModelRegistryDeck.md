# 📜 Dark Model Registry Deck  
**Protocol for Documenting Blackhat AI Models and Threat Attribution**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To tag and document adversarial AI models used in cybercrime, misinformation, and exploit orchestration, ensuring forensic traceability and civic containment.

---

## 🛠️ Registry Rituals  
- Tag model aliases: WormGPT, XXXGPT, WolfGPT, DarkBARD, FraudGPT  
- Document exploit capabilities: phishing, RAT scripting, misinformation, ransomware orchestration  
- Audit model lineage, training data poisoning, and jailbreak vectors  
- Align with MCP protocol, OWASP GenAI Top 10, and MITRE ATLAS mappings

---

## 📊 Registry Metrics  
- # of adversarial models detected in wild  
- # of exploits attributed to each model  
- # of threat actors linked to model usage  
- # of containment protocols deployed

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Dark models are not just tools—they are synthetic arsenals.  
Let every alias be tagged. Let every exploit be buffered with consequence.
