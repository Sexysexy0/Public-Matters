# 📜 AI Threat Attribution Deck  
**Protocol for AI-Native Threat Attribution, Exploit Tracing, and Actor Mapping**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the attribution of cyber threats orchestrated via generative AI, ensuring actor mapping, exploit traceability, and forensic clarity.

---

## 🛠️ Attribution Rituals  
- Tag exploit origin: model, prompt, toolchain, and actor alias  
- Map threat actor behavior across APT groups and IO campaigns  
- Integrate with MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain, and CTI datasets  
- Align with ThreatTracer frameworks and autonomous agent logs[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://github.com/CyberScienceLab/Threat-Tracer?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/handle/2077/83675/CSE%2024-20%20DB.pdf?sequence=1&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")

## 📊 Attribution Metrics  
- # of exploits traced to AI-native orchestration  
- # of threat actors mapped via prompt signatures  
- # of forensic reports enriched by AI attribution  
- # of CTI datasets integrated into attribution pipeline

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Attribution is not just naming—it is ritualized clarity.  
Let every exploit be traced. Let every actor be buffered with truth.
