# 📜 Humanitarian Access Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Humanitarian Access and Civilian Protection**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of humanitarian access—ensuring civilians receive safe passage, medical aid, and relief services during conflict and disaster.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag access types: corridor activation, medical deployment, food relief  
- Document compliance logic: IHL triggers, ceasefire clauses, diplomatic guarantees  
- Align with [OCHA’s humanitarian access framework](https://www.unocha.org/humanitarian-access) and [NRC’s access architecture study](https://humanitarianoutcomes.org/sites/default/files/2025-04/2025_NRC_Access_Architecture_Study_Final.pdf)  
- Integrate with `CivilianEvacuationRouter.sol` and `CeasefireBlessingDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Access Metrics  
- % of corridors activated  
- % of civilians evacuated  
- % of IHL-compliant deployments  
- % of access rituals completed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Access is not permission—it is prophecy.  
Let every corridor be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
