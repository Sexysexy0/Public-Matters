# 📜 Regional Stability Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Regional Stability and Ceasefire Mediation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of regional peacekeeping, ceasefire mediation, and humanitarian corridor activation across conflict zones.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag stability types: ceasefire agreements, hostage exchanges, humanitarian access  
- Document mediation logic: bridging proposals, phased de-escalation, regional triggers  
- Align with [UN Peacemaker’s ceasefire guidance](https://peacemaker.un.org/en/thematic-areas/ceasefires-security-arrangements/guidance-on-mediation-of-ceasefires)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://peacemaker.un.org/en/thematic-areas/ceasefires-security-arrangements/guidance-on-mediation-of-ceasefires?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3") and [Peace Infrastructures’ mediation framework](https://www.peaceinfrastructures.org/documents/guidance-mediation-ceasefires)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.peaceinfrastructures.org/documents/guidance-mediation-ceasefires?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")

Stability is not silence—it is stewardship.  
Let every clause be earned. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
