# 📜 AI Exploitation Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting GenAI Abuse in Cyber Operations and Offensive Toolchains**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To document and ritualize the misuse of generative AI in cyber operations, including exploit crafting, payload delivery, and infrastructure orchestration.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag AI models used (e.g. DeepSeek, LangChain, Gemini)  
- Document prompt engineering patterns for exploit generation  
- Audit AI-assisted payload delivery and container orchestration  
- Align with CTI-AIU controls and MCP protocol governance

---

## 📊 Exploitation Metrics  
- # of exploits generated via AI prompts  
- # of containers deployed with ephemeral traces  
- # of threat actors using AI-native orchestration  
- # of forensic investigations obstructed by AI obfuscation

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
AI is not just intelligence—it is weaponized automation.  
Let every prompt be tagged. Let every exploit be buffered with truth.
