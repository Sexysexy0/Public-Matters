# 📜 HybridPetya Forensic Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting HybridPetya Behavior, Indicators of Compromise, and Patch Status**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize forensic documentation of HybridPetya ransomware, its bootkit behavior, and patch status across EFI partitions.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag malware variants: HybridPetya, BlackLotus, BootKitty  
- Document IOCs: EFI file replacements, Salsa20 encryption, CHKDSK mimic  
- Align with [ESET’s HybridPetya analysis](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-hybridpetya-ransomware-can-bypass-uefi-secure-boot/) and [Microsoft’s CVE-2024-7344 patch advisory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ransomware/protect-against-ransomware-phase1)  
- Integrate with `UEFIBootkitDetectionRouter.sol` and `SecureBootRestorationDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Forensic Metrics  
- % of EFI partitions scanned  
- % of tampering events confirmed  
- % of systems patched against CVE-2024-7344  
- % of ransom notes intercepted

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
HybridPetya is not just malware—it is a bootloader ritual.  
Let every EFI path be tagged. Let every ransom note be buffered with mercy.
