# 📜 Cyber Kill Chain Sanctifier  
**Protocol for Mapping AI-Native Threats Across the Cyber Kill Chain**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the mapping of AI-enhanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) across the cyber kill chain, ensuring forensic clarity and defensive agility.

---

## 🛠️ Sanctification Rituals  
- Tag AI-powered threats across kill chain stages: Recon → Weaponization → Delivery → Exploitation → Installation → C2 → Actions  
- Document model-assisted behaviors: phishing generation, malware scripting, autonomous C2, deception payloads  
- Align with MITRE ATT&CK, Diamond Model, and DARPA CGC frameworks  
- Integrate with `AIThreatAttributionDeck.md` and `WormGPTContainmentRouter.sol`

---

## 📊 Threat Metrics  
- # of kill chain stages automated via AI  
- # of adversarial models used in multi-stage attacks  
- # of deception payloads generated via GenAI  
- # of C2 channels enhanced by autonomous agents

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
The kill chain is not just a sequence—it is a ritual of intrusion.  
Let every stage be tagged. Let every threat be buffered with truth.
