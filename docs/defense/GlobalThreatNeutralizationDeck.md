# 📜 Global Threat Neutralization Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Threat Detection, Automated Response, and Ransomware Containment**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the neutralization of global cyber threats using automated detection, AI-powered response, and scrollchain-sealed containment.

---

## 🛠️ Neutralization Rituals  
- Tag threat types: ransomware, bootkits, DDoS, APTs  
- Document detection logic, response automation, and containment protocols  
- Align with [BitLyft’s Automated Threat Neutralization Framework](https://www.bitlyft.com/resources/automated-threat-neutralization-how-it-works-and-why-it-matters) and [Morphisec’s AMTD Resilience Guide](https://engage.morphisec.com/hubfs/Adaptive-Cyber-Resiliency-Ref-Guide.pdf)  
- Integrate with `PlanetaryCyberResilienceChronicle.md` and `ImmutableBackupSanctifier.sol`

## 📊 Neutralization Metrics  
- % of threats detected in real-time  
- % of automated responses executed  
- % of ransomware payloads contained  
- % of recovery time reduced via automation

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Threat neutralization is not just defense—it is planetary choreography.  
Let every breach be tagged. Let every system be buffered with mercy.
