# 📜 Global Ransomware Threat Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Ransomware Threats, Bootkit Behavior, and Recovery Status**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of ransomware variants, bootkit infections, and global recovery efforts across sovereign digital sanctums.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag threats: HybridPetya, BlackLotus, BootKitty, NotPetya  
- Document IOCs, encryption behavior, ransom demands, and patch status  
- Align with [SentinelOne’s ransomware recovery guide](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cybersecurity/ransomware-recovery/) and [Adlumin’s recovery roadmap](https://adlumin.com/post/how-to-create-a-ransomware-recovery-roadmap/)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://adlumin.com/post/how-to-create-a-ransomware-recovery-roadmap/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cybersecurity/ransomware-recovery/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")  
- Integrate with `DigitalSanctumRecoveryRouter.sol` and `BootSanctifierProtocolDeck.md`
