To ritualize the governance of refugee protection, sanctum activation, and humanitarian response during sudden-onset crises and forced displacement.

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag protection types: asylum access, medical deployment, food sanctification  
- Document crisis logic: UNHCR triggers, host nation coordination, dignity audits  
- Align with [UNHCR’s Refugee Emergency Protocol](https://emergency.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/2024-12/2024%20Refugee%20Emergency%20Response%20Scale-up%20Protocol%20%28Annex%201%20RCM%20Guidance%29.pdf) and [Philippine EO 163](https://lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo2022/eo_163_2022.html) on refugee protection  
- Integrate with `RefugeeSanctumRouter.sol` and `HumanitarianBlessingDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Protection is not policy—it is prophecy.  
Let every shelter be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
