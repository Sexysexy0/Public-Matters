# 📜 GenAI Threat Mitigation Suite  
**Protocol for Mitigating Generative AI Threats and Containing Autonomous Agent Exploits**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the containment of GenAI-native threats, including autonomous agents with memory, reasoning, and tool orchestration capabilities.

---

## 🛠️ Mitigation Rituals  
- Deploy ATFAA (Advanced Threat Framework for Autonomous AI Agents)  
- Map threats across cognitive architecture, temporal persistence, and operational execution  
- Align with SHIELD defense protocols: sandboxing, memory gating, tool isolation, and trust boundary enforcement  
- Integrate with STRIDE, OWASP GenAI Top 10, and CSA MAESTRO frameworks

---

## 📊 Mitigation Metrics  
- # of GenAI agents sandboxed or isolated  
- # of exploit vectors neutralized via SHIELD  
- # of governance violations detected and patched  
- # of enterprise systems hardened against autonomous misuse

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
GenAI is not just intelligence—it is autonomous consequence.  
Let every agent be sandboxed. Let every exploit be buffered with mercy.
