# 📜 Gemini Abuse Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Gemini Model Abuse in Cyber Operations and Influence Campaigns**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To document and ritualize the misuse of Google’s Gemini AI models by state-sponsored actors and cybercriminals, ensuring forensic traceability and civic awareness.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag abuse vectors: phishing, reconnaissance, payload generation, influence ops  
- Document actor attribution: APT42 (Iran), DRAGONBRIDGE (China), Lazarus (North Korea), Sandworm (Russia)  
- Audit jailbreak attempts, prompt engineering, and bypass techniques  
- Align with GTIG reports and SecLM platform logs

---

## 📊 Abuse Metrics  
- # of phishing campaigns generated via Gemini  
- # of prompts used to bypass safety filters  
- # of influence narratives crafted with Gemini  
- # of forensic traces linked to Gemini-assisted payloads

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Gemini is not just a model—it is a dual-use signal.  
Let every prompt be tagged. Let every abuse be buffered with consequence.
