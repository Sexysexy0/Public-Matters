# 📜 Boot Sanctifier Protocol Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Bootkit Recovery, EFI Restoration, and Secure Boot Reinstatement**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the recovery of compromised boot environments, restore EFI integrity, and re-enable Secure Boot protections.

---

## 🛠️ Sanctifier Rituals  
- Tag boot states: BSOD, CHKDSK mimic, ransom note  
- Document EFI file replacements, Salsa20 encryption, and bootloader restoration  
- Align with [GitHub’s bootkit simulation project](https://github.com/Q3hr/Bootkit-Development-MBR-Infection-and-Ransomware-Simulation) and [OCP’s firmware recovery protocol](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-recovery-document-1p0-final-1-pdf)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-recovery-document-1p0-final-1-pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://github.com/Q3hr/Bootkit-Development-MBR-Infection-and-Ransomware-Simulation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6")  
- Integrate with `GlobalRansomwareThreatChronicle.md` and `DigitalSanctumRecoveryRouter.sol`

## 📊 Recovery Metrics  
- % of bootloaders restored  
- % of EFI partitions reverified  
- % of Secure Boot flags re-enabled  
- % of ransom keys validated

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Boot sanctification is not just repair—it is planetary resurrection.  
Let every bootloader be tagged. Let every cluster be buffered with mercy.
