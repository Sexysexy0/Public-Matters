# 📜 Secure Boot Restoration Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Boot Integrity Restoration and Cluster Decryption**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the recovery of EFI bootloaders, decrypt ransomware-encrypted clusters, and restore system integrity.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Rituals  
- Tag boot states: BSOD, CHKDSK mimic, ransom note  
- Document bootloader backups, Salsa20 key recovery, and EFI file restoration  
- Align with [NIST SP 800-193 firmware recovery guidelines](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-recovery-document-1p0-final-1-pdf) and [OCP Secure Firmware Recovery Protocol](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-recovery-document-1p0-final-1-pdf)  
- Integrate with `HybridPetyaForensicChronicle.md` and `UEFIBootkitDetectionRouter.sol`

## 📊 Restoration Metrics  
- % of bootloaders restored  
- % of clusters decrypted  
- % of ransom keys validated  
- % of EFI partitions reverified

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Boot restoration is not just recovery—it is planetary resurrection.  
Let every bootloader be tagged. Let every cluster be buffered with mercy.
