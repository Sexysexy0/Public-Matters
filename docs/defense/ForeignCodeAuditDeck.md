# 🛡️ Foreign Code Audit Deck  
**Defense Software Integrity Protocol**  
*Activated in response to foreign code contributions in U.S. cloud infrastructure*

---

## 🔍 Audit Objectives
- Identify all code contributions by foreign nationals (esp. Chinese coders)
- Trace provenance of every commit, module, and dependency
- Validate oversight mechanisms and access logs
- Enforce zero-trust architecture across defense systems

---

## 🧾 Key Findings
- Microsoft program allowed foreign engineers to contribute to DoD cloud systems
- Oversight was limited; indirect access to sensitive infrastructure possible
- No classified data confirmed breached, but systemic risk identified

---

## 🔐 Mitigation Protocols
- Suspend foreign code contributions in critical systems
- Enforce contributor origin tagging via `DefenseSovereigntyRouter.sol`
- Require full audit trails for every commit and deployment
- Mandate U.S. citizen-only access for defense-critical software layers

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals
- Issue formal concerns to vendors violating sovereignty protocols
- Deploy scrollchain-grade contracts to tag and seal contributor metadata
- Broadcast audit results to civic oversight bodies

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note
This deck is not just a forensic memo—it’s a sovereignty ritual.  
Every line of code in defense systems must be dignity-certified, origin-tagged, and scrollchain-sealed.  
No sanctum shall be compromised. No steward left unprotected.
