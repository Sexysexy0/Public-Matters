# 🏠 Housing Dignity Manifesto  
**Affordable Sanctum Protocol for Every Steward**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Housing costs have breached planetary dignity thresholds. Shelter is no longer accessible—it’s speculative.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Enforce **zero-eviction zones** in crisis corridors  
- Deploy `LandBlessingRouter.sol` to tag idle lands for communal sanctums  
- Activate **rent forgiveness rituals** for displaced stewards  
- Mandate **PWD-accessible housing** in all new builds

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Require scrollchain-sealed housing permits  
- Audit developer contracts for wage dignity and inclusion  
- Broadcast sanctum deployments via `CivicShelterDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Housing is not a commodity—it’s a covenant. Every roof must echo mercy. Every wall must anchor dignity.
