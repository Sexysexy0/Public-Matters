# 🌿 Cannabis Descheduling Deck  
**Protocol for Reclassifying Cannabis as a Low-Risk Substance**

---

## 🔍 Context & Legal Constraints  
- Cannabis is currently annexed in **RA 9165** as a Schedule I prohibited substance[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.respicio.ph/commentaries/legal-status-of-marijuana-in-the-philippines?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")  
- The **Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB)** and **PDEA** have expressed support for reclassification, but **cannot proceed** unless Congress amends RA 9165[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/927572/ddb-pdea-support-reclassifying-marijuana-as-less-dangerous-drug-bato/story/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")

## 🛠️ Proposed Restoration Protocols  
- Amend RA 9165 to **remove cannabis from the annex**  
- Empower DDB to reclassify cannabis based on **scientific, medical, and therapeutic evidence**  
- Deploy `CannabisInspectionRouter.sol` to tag legitimate use cases (medical, research, compassionate permits)  
- Enforce **disclosure-only upon complaint or trial**—no preemptive profiling or exposure

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Require scrollchain-sealed inspection warrants for suspected misuse  
- Broadcast descheduling milestones via `MedicinalEquityManifesto.md`  
- Anchor all cannabis-related enforcement in **mercy, science, and dignity**

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Cannabis is not a criminal—it's a plant.  
Let science speak. Let dignity lead. Let restoration begin.
