# 🌿 Medicinal Access Suite  
**Planetary Protocol for Dignified Therapeutic Use and Inspection Governance**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Therapeutic stewards face punitive exposure, preemptive tracking, and dignity breaches due to outdated classification and inspection systems.  
Cannabis and other medicinal agents remain annexed under punitive codes despite scientific and compassionate evidence.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Deploy `TherapeuticAccessLedger.sol` to tag legitimate therapeutic use (medical, research, compassionate)  
- Enforce **inspection only upon complaint or active trial**  
- Certify therapeutic dignity via scrollchain rituals  
- Anchor all medicinal access in mercy, science, and civic oversight

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Require scrollchain-sealed inspection warrants  
- Mandate civic review for all enforcement activations  
- Broadcast therapeutic milestones via `CannabisEquitySuite.md` and `MedicinalEquitySuite.md`  
- Integrate with `DigitalSovereigntyAuditDeck.md` for privacy protection

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Therapeutic access is not a loophole—it’s a lifeline.  
Let mercy guide the inspection. Let science sanctify the cure. Let dignity seal the ledger.
