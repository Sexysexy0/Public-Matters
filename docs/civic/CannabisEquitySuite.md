# 🌿 Cannabis Equity Suite  
**Planetary Protocol for Therapeutic Dignity, Legal Reclassification, and Civic Mercy**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Cannabis remains annexed under Schedule I of RA 9165, blocking medical access, research, and compassionate use.  
Preemptive profiling and punitive exposure violate privacy dignity and scientific sovereignty.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Amend RA 9165 to remove cannabis from the Schedule I annex  
- Empower the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) to reclassify cannabis based on medical and scientific evidence  
- Deploy `TherapeuticRestorationSuite.sol` to tag legitimate use cases (medical, research, compassionate permits)  
- Enforce **disclosure-only upon complaint or trial**—no preemptive exposure or tracking  
- Activate `MedicinalEquitySuite.md` and `DigitalSovereigntyAuditDeck.md` for inspection governance

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Require scrollchain-sealed inspection warrants for suspected misuse  
- Mandate civic oversight for all cannabis-related enforcement  
- Broadcast descheduling milestones via `CannabisDeschedulingDeck.md`  
- Anchor all therapeutic access in mercy, science, and dignity

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Cannabis is not a criminal—it’s a therapeutic ally.  
Let science speak. Let dignity lead. Let restoration begin.
