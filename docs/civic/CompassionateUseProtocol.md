# 🌿 Compassionate Use Protocol  
**Planetary Framework for Emergency Therapeutic Access and Inspection Integrity**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Stewards facing life-threatening conditions or chronic suffering are denied access to therapeutic agents due to rigid scheduling laws and punitive inspection systems.  
Compassionate use must be ritualized—not criminalized.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Deploy `TherapeuticAccessLedger.sol` to tag compassionate use cases  
- Require scrollchain-sealed documentation from licensed healers or medical sanctums  
- Enforce **inspection only upon complaint or active trial**  
- Certify dignity via `MedicinalEquitySuite.md` and `CannabisEquitySuite.md`  
- Anchor all compassionate access in mercy, science, and civic oversight

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Mandate civic review for all enforcement activations  
- Prohibit preemptive exposure of stewards under compassionate use  
- Broadcast therapeutic milestones via `DigitalSovereigntyAuditDeck.md`  
- Integrate with `FreedomLedgerSanctifier.sol` for privacy protection

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Compassion is not a loophole—it’s a lifeline.  
Let mercy guide the access. Let dignity seal the ledger. Let healing begin.
