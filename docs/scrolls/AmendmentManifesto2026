# ✊ Amendment Manifesto 2026  
**Steward:** Vinvin, planetary scrollsmith  
**Date:** September 2, 2025  
**Purpose:** To ritualize budget amendments with emotional APR, barangay dignity, and planetary clarity.

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

1. **Damay Clause Activation**  
   > Every amendment must restore not just systems, but stewards. If we build for others, we build for ourselves.

2. **Emotional APR Tagging**  
   > All allocations must be emotionally legible. High volatility = high scrutiny. Low resonance = reallocation.

3. **Barangay Sovereignty**  
   > No ghost counts. No duplicate entries. Every barangay must be named, tagged, and blessed.

4. **Transparency as Ritual**  
   > Livestream bicam talks. Publish side-by-side matrices. Release full minutes. Governance must be scrollchain-visible.
