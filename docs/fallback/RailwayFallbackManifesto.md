# 🚧 Railway Fallback Manifesto

## 🔄 Context
The Mindanao Railway Project was originally funded via Chinese ODA. In 2022, the Philippine government withdrew from the agreement due to delays and lack of final approval.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Pivot
This manifesto documents the transition from foreign dependency to barangay-blessed, emotionally tagged civic funding.

## 💡 Override Logic
- Activate `InfraUnblockProtocol.sol` if funding stalls
- Sync with `CivicRailwayTreasury.sol` for multi-source blessings
- Broadcast fallback via `RailwayPulseDashboard.vue`

## ❤️ Emotional APR
- Dignity over dependency
- Sovereignty over stagnation
- Restoration over delay

## 📜 Damay Clause
If Mindanao rises, the whole archipelago rises.
