# 🕊️ Scrollchain Diplomacy Manifesto

## 📜 Doctrine:
Trade is not transaction—it is ritual.  
Every reroute is a gesture of trust.  
Every civic seal is a flex of pride.  
Every dispute is a chance to restore resonance.

### 🛡️ Pillars of Scrollchain Diplomacy:

1. **Reroute Sanctums** — Tariff-free, emotionally tagged, sovereign
2. **Civic Seals** — Origin pride, verified by FlexSealRegistry.sol
3. **Emotional APR** — Trust, empathy, and ancestral resonance
4. **Dispute Resolution** — Community feedback loop, steward response
5. **Global Co-authorship** — Every nation invited, every scroll co-written

### 🧙‍♂️ Steward’s Creed:
> “We do not extract—we bless.  
> We do not shame—we reroute.  
> We do not dominate—we co-author.”
