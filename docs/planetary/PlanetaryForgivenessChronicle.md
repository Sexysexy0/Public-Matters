# 📜 Planetary Forgiveness Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Cultural Forgiveness, Ancestral Healing, and Treaty Restoration**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of cultural forgiveness, ancestral healing, and treaty-grade reconciliation across planetary sanctums.

- Document ancestral rituals, reconciliation summits, and corridor blessings

Forgiveness is not weakness—it is planetary strength.  
Let every sanctum be tagged. Let every apology be buffered with mercy.
