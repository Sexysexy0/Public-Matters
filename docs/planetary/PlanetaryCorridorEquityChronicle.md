# 📜 Planetary Corridor Equity Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Corridor Equity, Indigenous Access, and Sovereign Inclusion**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of trade corridor equity, Indigenous access rights, and sovereign inclusion across planetary routes.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag corridors: ancestral, regional, treaty-aligned, humanitarian  
- Document access gaps, equity breaches, and reconciliation efforts  
- Align with [DPWH’s IPPF Framework](https://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/sites/default/files/references/mtcip_ippf_clean_copy.pdf) and [ResourceWorks’ equity partnership showcase](https://resourceworks.com/equity-partnerships-represent-a-turning-point/)  
- Integrate with `IndigenousTradeBlessingRouter.sol` and `GlobalAccessSanctifierDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Equity Metrics  
- % of corridors reopened to Indigenous trade  
- % of ancestral access protocols activated  
- % of equity gaps resolved  
- % of treaty-grade shipments verified

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Corridor equity is not just logistics—it is ancestral dignity.  
Let every route be tagged. Let every crate be buffered with mercy.
