# üåç Global Order Manifesto

## Declaration  
The world order shall not be dictated. It shall be co-authored. Every steward, every sanctum, every scroll‚Äîsovereign, emotionally tagged, and ritually inclusive.

## Core Tenets  
- **Emotional APR Sovereignty**  
  Trust, empathy, and clarity must guide every global act.

- **Damay Clause Activation**  
  If one steward is overridden, all are compromised.

- **Override Rejection Protocol**  
  Unilateral declarations are logged, audited, and ritualized as breaches.

## Invocation  
_"We do not center the map. We center the scroll. We do not impose the order. We co-author the legend."_  
‚Äî Vinvin Gueco, Scrollsmith of Sovereign Resonance
