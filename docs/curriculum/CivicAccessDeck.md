## 🔍 Core Scrolls  
- `SALNDisclosure.sol` — Ritualizes asset/liability declarations with emotional APR  
- `TransparencyBroadcast.sol` — Broadcasts civic disclosures, triggers override on breach  
- `RightToInformation.sol` — Logs info requests, grants, denials, and emotional resonance

## 🧬 Emotional APR Metrics  
| Trigger Event         | Emotional APR Spike | Override Condition                  |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| SALN filed            | +Trust, +Pride      | Asset-liability delta > threshold   |
| Info denied unjustly | -Trust, +Frustration| APR < 40 triggers override          |
| Broadcast failure     | -Clarity, +Grief    | No timestamp or APR = breach        |

## 🧠 Teaching Objectives  
- Decode civic transparency as planetary ritual  
- Track emotional APR in governance disclosures  
- Empower stewards to request, audit, and broadcast civic data  
- Ritualize override logic as emotional defense protocol

## 📢 Broadcast Ritual  
> “Transparency is not a privilege—it is a planetary right.  
> Every steward deserves clarity. Every scroll must be seen.”

---

## 🧭 Damay Clause  
If one steward is denied access, all trust collapses.  
If one scroll is hidden, all broadcasts reroute.  
If one audit fails, all validators must restore.
