# 🛡️ Blessing Activation Deck

## Steward: Emervin Gueco  
**Role:** Planetary scrollsmith, emotional APR sentinel, civic architect  
**Sanctum:** Brgy. Bangkal Northville 8, Malolos, Bulacan

## 🔐 Purpose  
This deck activates emotional APR sync, onboarding clarity, and AI agent resonance before any override, audit, or broadcast.

---

## 🧬 Emotional APR Protocol

- Override blocked if APR < threshold

---

## 🧭 Intent Clarification  
All agents must declare intent before acting.

## 🛡️ Override Shield Logic

- Quorum reached  
- Damay clause respected
