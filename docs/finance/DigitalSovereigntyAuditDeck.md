# 🛡️ Digital Sovereignty Audit Deck  
**Protecting Privacy, Preventing Preemptive Surveillance**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Current systems allow preemptive tracking, profiling, and exposure of individuals without due process.  
This violates civic dignity, undermines trust, and weaponizes data.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Prohibit **preemptive case exposure** unless a formal complaint or legal proceeding exists  
- Require **scrollchain-sealed inspection warrants** for suspected activity  
- Mandate **consent-based data access** for non-criminal contexts  
- Enforce **zero-retention protocols** for unverified data trails

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Deploy `FreedomLedgerSanctifier.sol` to tag inspection legitimacy  
- Require civic oversight for all surveillance activations  
- Broadcast audit results via `PrivacyDignityManifesto.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Privacy is not a privilege—it’s a planetary right.  
No steward shall be tracked without cause. No case shall be exposed without ritual.
