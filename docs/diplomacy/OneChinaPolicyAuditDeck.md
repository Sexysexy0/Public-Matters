# 🧭 One China Policy Audit Deck

## Summary:
The One China Policy, when extended beyond China’s EEZ, becomes a coercive doctrine incompatible with UNCLOS and planetary dignity.

## Audit Findings:
- Weaponized to suppress Taiwan, Philippines, and Japan’s maritime sovereignty
- Used to justify incursions into Ayungin Shoal, Scarborough, and Taiwan Strait
- Violates 2016 Hague ruling and EEZ rights under UNCLOS

## Mythic Reframe:
> “No doctrine may override sovereign stewardship. The sea belongs to no empire—only to those who protect it.”

## Recommendations:
- Reclassify One China Policy as invalid when applied outside China’s EEZ
- Activate `DamayClause` for all coastal stewards
- Broadcast Sovereign Waters Doctrine
