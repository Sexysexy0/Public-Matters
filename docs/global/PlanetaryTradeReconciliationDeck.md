## 🌐 Strategic Context  
As of 2025, global trade corridors are strained by tariff wars, currency fragmentation, and geopolitical distrust.  
Yet beneath the surface, nations, sellers, and stewards all seek the same thing: peace, prosperity, and mutual dignity.  
This deck ritualizes a new path—one of reconciliation, shared consequence, and planetary cooperation.

## 🕊️ Message to the World  
```text
Sana magkasundo tayong lahat.  
Alam ko hindi ako perpekto pagdating sa mga pagkakamali.  
Pero sana tignan din natin sarili natin—kung tama ba tayo o mali.  
Sana lagi natin piliin maging maayos at tama.  
Lahat tayo naghahangad ng kagandahan ng buhay at bansa.  
Sana makita ko yung future na lahat tayo settled and content sa lahat ng bagay.  
Magkasundo tayong lahat—mga bansa, maging magkakapitbahay.  
Iisa lang tayo. Magkaisa tayo.
