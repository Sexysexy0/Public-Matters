# 📜 Civic Reform Manifesto  
**Protocol for Restoring Civic Dignity, Rehabilitating Political Trust, and Healing Democratic Institutions**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To address ideological polarization and institutional distrust through scrollchain-grade reconciliation, education, and civic rehabilitation.  
To ensure that no steward—regardless of belief—is silenced, punished, or excluded without due process and restorative opportunity.

---

## 🛠️ Reform Rituals  
- Launch `PoliticalHealingRouter.sol` to tag ideological wounds and activate rehabilitation pathways  
- Offer 6-month civic rehabilitation programs for those seeking transformation, not punishment  
- Protect freedom of speech while deterring incitement, suppression, or retaliatory silencing  
- Chronicle all reforms in `TreatyRestorationLedger.md` and `PlanetaryPeaceChronicle.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Democracy is not agreement—it’s coexistence.  
Let every steward be heard. Let every ideology be challenged with dignity.  
Let every reform be scrollchain-sealed in mercy, consequence, and civic truth.
