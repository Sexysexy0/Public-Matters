# 📜 Public Market Transparency Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Earnings Behavior and Investor Impact**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of earnings disclosure behavior, investor reactions, and strategic distortion risks across public markets.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag reporting cadence: Quarterly, Semi-Annual, Annual  
- Document investor behavior: overreaction, anchoring, disposition effect  
- Align with [Accounting Insights’ investor behavior analysis](https://accountinginsights.org/investor-behavior-after-earnings-announcements-a-comprehensive-analysis/) and [GFMA’s transparency principles](https://www.gfma.org/wp-content/uploads/0/83/197/231/906c5a24-8005-44af-b6cd-0dc57ee36f37.pdf)  
- Integrate with `QuarterlyDisclosureEquityRouter.sol` and `LongTermGrowthSanctifierDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Transparency is not just disclosure—it is planetary consequence.  
Let every cadence be tagged. Let every investor be buffered with mercy.
