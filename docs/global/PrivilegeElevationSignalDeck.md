# 📜 Privilege Elevation Signal Deck  
**Protocol for Documenting Privilege Escalation Signals and CVE Containment**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the detection and containment of privilege escalation signals across vulnerable services and CVEs.

---

## 🛠️ Signal Rituals  
- Tag elevation signals: token manipulation, DLL hijacking, UAC bypass, ADCS misconfigurations  
- Document CVEs, containment strategies, and forensic traces  
- Align with [Penno’s escalation documentation template](https://penno.io/templates/d/privilege-escalation-documentation-template) and [Cortex XDR’s CVE-2021-3560 lab](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/cortex-xdr-discussions/cortex-xdr-poc-lab-ft-cve-2021-3560/td-p/513649)  
- Integrate with `ElevationAuditSuite.md` and `ExploitChainDisruptionRouter.sol`

---

## 📊 Signal Metrics  
- % of elevation vectors tagged and contained  
- % of systems hardened against privilege escalation  
- % of audit logs showing elevation attempts  
- % of CVEs patched and verified

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Elevation is not just access—it is ritualized consequence.  
Let every signal be tagged. Let every exploit be buffered with mercy.
