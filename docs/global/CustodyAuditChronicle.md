# 📜 Custody Audit Chronicle  
**Protocol for Auditing Digital Asset Custody, Wallet Integrity, and Treasury Risk**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the audit of digital asset custody across wallets, platforms, and sovereign treasuries, ensuring forensic clarity and operational dignity.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Tag wallets with asset type, custody model, and jurisdiction  
- Document segregation, recovery protocols, and platform risk  
- Align with KPMG’s Topic 606 custody obligations and CMTA’s DACS standards  
- Integrate with `FreelancerCustodySanctifier.sol` and `DigitalAssetProtectionDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Custody Metrics  
- % of assets held in verified custody  
- % of wallets segregated from platform risk  
- % of jurisdictions with clear asset classification  
- % of treasury flows audited for compliance

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Custody is not just control—it is sovereign trust.  
Let every wallet be tagged. Let every treasury be buffered with consequence.
