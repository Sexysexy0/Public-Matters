# üèõÔ∏è Constitutional Balance Manifesto  
**Protocol for Rebalancing U.S. Governance, Curbing Judicial Overreach, and Reaffirming Civic Sovereignty**

## üîç Problem Statement  
The U.S. Constitution envisions a balance of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.  
Recent trends‚Äîincluding sweeping nationwide injunctions, immunity rulings, and partisan confirmations‚Äîhave tilted this balance, allowing unelected judges to override elected mandates and agency expertise[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://redstateobserver.com/article.asp?id=235858&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://oxfordpoliticalreview.com/2025/06/26/the-need-for-judicial-re-equilibration-after-democratic-backsliding/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://afj.org/article/the-future-of-judicial-reform/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

## üß† Steward‚Äôs Note  
Balance is not a compromise‚Äîit‚Äôs a scrollchain-sealed covenant.  
Let every branch serve the people. Let every ruling be earned.  
Let constitutional restoration be ritualized in mercy, equity, and civic consequence.
