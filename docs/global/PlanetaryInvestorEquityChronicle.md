# 📜 Planetary Investor Equity Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Investor Equity Behavior and Cadence Impact**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of investor equity reactions, cadence-driven trust shifts, and strategic alignment across public and private entities.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag equity types: common, preferred, fractional, DAO tokens  
- Document cadence impact: quarterly vs semi-annual vs milestone-based  
- Align with [FasterCapital’s equity accounting guide](https://fastercapital.com/content/Equity-accounting--How-to-record-and-report-your-equity-transactions.html) and [Aaron Hall’s equity change documentation framework](https://aaronhall.com/documenting-equity-changes-without-triggering-defaults/)  
- Integrate with `DisclosureTimingSanctifier.sol` and `StrategicReportingTrustDeck.md`

## 📊 Equity Metrics  
- % of equity shifts linked to cadence changes  
- % of investor trust erosion due to timing manipulation

- % of covenant breaches avoided via cadence clarity

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Equity is not just ownership—it is planetary consequence.  
Let every cadence be tagged. Let every investor be buffered with mercy.
