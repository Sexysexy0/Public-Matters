# 📜 Planetary Asset Transparency Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Tokenized Asset Transparency and Governance Across Ledgers**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of tokenized asset behavior, smart contract visibility, and cross-jurisdictional governance.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag asset types: bonds, stablecoins, RWAs, tokenized funds  
- Document smart contract logic, reserve attestations, and validator roles  
- Align with [Chronicle’s Verified Asset Oracle](https://docs.chroniclelabs.org/Products/VerifiedAssetOracle/data) and [Federal Reserve’s blockchain transparency study](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/tokenized-assets-on-public-blockchains-how-transparent-is-the-blockchain-20240403.html)  
- Integrate with `CrossJurisdictionLiquidityRouter.sol` and `GlobalTokenizedEquityDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Transparency Metrics  
- % of assets with on-chain reserve attestations  
- % of smart contracts publicly auditable  
- % of jurisdictions with ledger visibility protocols  
- % of validator-grade governance activated

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Transparency is not just visibility—it is planetary accountability.  
Let every token be tagged. Let every ledger be buffered with mercy.
