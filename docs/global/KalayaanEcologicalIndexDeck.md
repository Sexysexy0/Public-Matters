# 📜 Kalayaan Ecological Index Deck  
**Protocol for Reef Health Metrics, Biodiversity Tagging, and Ecological Sovereignty Assertion**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To quantify and ritualize the ecological health of reef features in the Kalayaan Island Group, ensuring marine resilience and sovereign stewardship.

---

## 🛠️ Index Rituals  
- Tag reef features with coral cover %, fish biomass, and species richness  
- Document restoration sites, sanctuary boundaries, and patrol logs  
- Align with PCG, DENR, and NFRDI biodiversity protocols  
- Integrate with `ReefProtectionSanctifier.sol` and `MarineSanctuaryChronicle.md`

---

## 📊 Ecological Metrics  
- % of reef features with active restoration protocols  
- % of coral cover in shallow and mesophotic zones  
- # of reef fish species per feature (e.g. 155 species in Sabina Shoal)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.nfrdi.da.gov.ph/tpjf/etc/Coral%20Reef%20Habitat%20and%20Associated%20Reef%20Fishes%20in%20the%20Kalayaan%20Island%20Group%20West%20Philippine%20Sea.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")  
- % of sanctuary zones with permanent monitoring stations

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Ecology is not just habitat—it is sovereign life.  
Let every reef be tagged with mercy. Let every species be buffered with consequence.
