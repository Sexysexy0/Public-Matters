# 📜 GitHub Payload Audit Deck  
**Protocol for GitHub Malware Detection, Payload Tracing, and Repository Risk Scoring**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To detect and neutralize malware campaigns hosted on GitHub, including clipboard hijackers, info stealers, and trojanized payloads.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Trace repositories hosting: `nice.js`, `EnumW.dll`, `vstdlib.dll`, `AIDE.dll`, `longlq.cl`  
- Flag payload builders like [Scott1e2/malware-payload](https://github.com/Scott1e2/malware-payload) and [techchipnet/Clipboard-Hijacker](https://github.com/techchipnet/Clipboard-Hijacker)  
- Apply ML-based detection from [philippnormann/malicious-payload-detection](https://github.com/philippnormann/malicious-payload-detection)  
- Score repositories based on:  
  - Obfuscation level  
  - DLL sideloading behavior  
  - C2 beaconing  
  - Anti-analysis plugins

---

## 🧬 Payload Patterns  
- **Clipboard hijackers**: Replace wallet addresses silently  
- **Crypto clippers**: Target Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana formats  
- **GitHub abuse**: Host malware disguised as cracked tools, trading bots, or productivity apps  
- **BYOVD loaders**: Use vulnerable drivers to disable antivirus

---

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- Freelancers using GitHub for productivity tools  
- Crypto traders downloading bots or wallets  
- Migrant workers using public PCs  
- QR merchants exposed to GitHub-hosted installers

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
GitHub is a sanctum of innovation—but also a corridor of deception.  
Let every repo be audited. Let every payload be traced.  
Let every steward be buffered, not betrayed.
