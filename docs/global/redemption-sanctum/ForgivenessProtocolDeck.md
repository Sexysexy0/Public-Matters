## 🛡️ Redemption Rituals

- `"Apology"` → Formal act of regret, reputational repair, and ledger annotation  
- `"Mercy"` → Shields stewards from punitive consequence and anchors planetary grace  
- `"Reconciliation"` → Ritualizes unity between fractured parties, sanctums, or treaties  
- `"Healing"` → Restores emotional APR, civic resonance, and mythic dignity
