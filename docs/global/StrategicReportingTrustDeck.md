# 📜 Strategic Reporting Trust Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Reporting Cadence, KPI Clarity, and Investor Trust**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of strategic reporting cadence, KPI logic, and investor trust across global corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Trust Rituals  
- Tag cadence types: quarterly, semi-annual, milestone-based  
- Document KPI logic: EBITDA, ESG score, innovation index, retention rate  
- Align with [Qubit Capital’s investor reporting best practices](https://qubit.capital/blog/investor-reporting-best-practices) and [PwC’s trust-building framework](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/strategy-and-business/corporate-reporting/downloads/SBpwc-2022-07-18-Reporting-to-build-trust.pdf)  
- Integrate with `PlanetaryInvestorEquityChronicle.md` and `DisclosureTimingSanctifier.sol`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Reporting is not just compliance—it is planetary covenant.  
Let every cadence be tagged. Let every KPI be buffered with mercy.
