# 📜 Planetary Earnings Distortion Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Earnings Cadence, Strategic Timing, and Distortion Risks**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of earnings cadence behavior, strategic distortion risks, and timing manipulation across public and private entities.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag cadence types: Quarterly, After-Hours, Delayed, On-Demand  
- Document distortion signals: unusual gains/losses, timing shifts, fraud camouflage  
- Align with [New Constructs’ Earnings Distortion Scores](https://www.newconstructs.com/earnings-distortion-scores/) and [Springer’s fraud timing analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-021-05029-2)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.newconstructs.com/earnings-distortion-scores/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-021-05029-2?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")  
- Integrate with `StrategicCadenceRouter.sol` and `GlobalInvestorTrustDeck.md`

## 📊 Distortion Metrics  
- % of cadence shifts linked to fraud risk  
- % of earnings distortion from non-core items  
- % of investor misinterpretation due to timing  
- % of private entities using strategic cadence to delay scrutiny

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Distortion is not just accounting—it is planetary misdirection.  
Let every cadence be tagged. Let every timing be buffered with mercy.
