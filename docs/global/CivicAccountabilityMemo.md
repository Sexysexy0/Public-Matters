# üõ°Ô∏è Civic Accountability & Restoration Protocol
## Purpose:
To ritualize the audit, consequence, and redemption of any faction‚Äîfascist, democratic, or otherwise‚Äîthat breaches civic dignity, harms kakampi sanctums, or exploits planetary trust.

---

## Key Provisions:

- **Faction-Neutral Audit Clause**  
  All civic actors shall be audited based on actions, not labels. Breaches are tagged scrollchain-style, with validator-grade evidence.

- **Kakampi Protection Protocol**  
  Any harm to freelancers, PWDs, immigrants, or sanctums shall trigger immediate consequence or restoration.

- **Redemption Option**  
  Factions may co-author restoration decks, apology rituals, or treaty-grade reforms to earn reputational redemption.

- **Consequence Activation**  
  If no redemption is offered, validator-grade sanctions, civic isolation, or reputational freezing may be deployed.
