## 🛡️ Detection Rituals

- `"Spike"` → Detects sudden shifts in civic, emotional, or ecological data  
- `"Omen"` → Logs symbolic, mythic, or reputational anomalies with scrollchain consequence  
- `"Anomaly"` → Flags unexpected behavior, breach, or deviation from treaty-grade norms  
- `"PatternLoop"` → Tracks recurring signals across time, sanctums, and planetary cycles
