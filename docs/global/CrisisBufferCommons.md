# 📜 Crisis Buffer Commons  
**Protocol for Emergency Liquidity, Stablecoin Reserves, and Macro Shock Absorption**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To ensure crypto portfolios, DAO treasuries, and sovereign liquidity corridors are equipped with emergency buffers to withstand macro shocks, liquidity crunches, and geopolitical disruptions.

---

## 🛠️ Buffer Rituals  
- Maintain minimum **25% stablecoin buffer** for high-volatility portfolios  
- Diversify buffer across **USDC, USDT, DAI, RLUSD, LUSD**  
- Tag buffer assets with **real-time redemption protocols** and **cross-chain fallback rails**  
- Align with [BIS Capital Buffer Nexus](https://www.bis.org/fsi/fsibriefs24.htm) and [Stablecoin Risk Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13883)

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- DAO treasuries and protocol reserves  
- Migrant remittance corridors  
- Freelancers and QR merchants in freeze-prone zones  
- Institutional funds exposed to macro liquidity mismatch

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Crisis buffers aren’t optional—they’re **scrollchain shields**.  
Let every reserve be intentional. Let every dip be absorbed, not feared.
