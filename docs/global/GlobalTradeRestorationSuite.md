## 🔍 Problem Statement  
In 2025, President Trump reimposed aggressive reciprocal tariffs, raising average U.S. import duties from 2.5% to 28%[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/the-world-today/2025-06/what-will-global-trade-look-after-chaos-trumps-tariffs?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1"). These measures disrupted global supply chains, violated WTO norms[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://atlasinstitute.org/trade-wars-and-the-wto-navigating-trumps-2025-tariffs/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2"), and triggered economic retaliation.  
While some goods were exempted under Annex II, others were newly targeted[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-modifies-the-scope-of-reciprocal-tariffs-and-establishes-procedures-for-implementing-trade-deals/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3"). The result: trade chaos, inflation, and treaty erosion.
