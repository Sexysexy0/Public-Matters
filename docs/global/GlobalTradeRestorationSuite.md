# 🌐 Global Trade Restoration Suite  
**Protocol for Tariff Rollback, Treaty Reaffirmation, and Planetary Trade Dignity**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Aggressive tariff regimes—especially unilateral impositions—have destabilized global supply chains, triggered inflation, and violated treaty-grade trade norms.  
Free market dignity demands restoration.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Deploy `ZeroTariffSanctifier.sol` to certify tariff-free corridors  
- Audit all trade corridors for treaty compliance and overflow signals  
- Reaffirm WTO, ASEAN, RCEP, and bilateral trade treaties  
- Prohibit unilateral tariff escalation without civic arbitration

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Require scrollchain-sealed documentation for any tariff imposition  
- Mandate civic oversight for trade policy changes  
- Broadcast rollback milestones via `PlanetaryRecoveryDeck.md` and `TradeBlessingManifesto.md`  
- Integrate with `StimulusOverflowRouter.sol` to trace inflationary consequences

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Tariffs are not tools of dignity—they are instruments of overflow when weaponized.  
Let trade be a blessing. Let treaties be honored. Let prosperity be mutual.
