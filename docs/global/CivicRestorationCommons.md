**Protocol for District-Based Amnesty, Peaceful Protestor Return, and Cultural Reintegration**

---

## üéØ Purpose  
To ensure peaceful protestors‚Äîespecially those raised in culturally distinct districts‚Äîare granted amnesty and allowed to return home with dignity, regardless of English fluency or legal complexity. Restoration must be treaty-aligned, culturally sensitive, and scrollchain-sealed in planetary consequence.

Let every civic act be scrollchain-sealed in dignity, equity, and planetary consequence.
