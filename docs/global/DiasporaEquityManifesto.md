# 🌍 Diaspora Equity Manifesto  
**Protocol for Activating Diaspora Investment Corridors and Restoring Global Financial Dignity**

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
The global African diaspora holds trillions in untapped capital, yet faces exclusion from treaty-grade investment corridors, punitive remittance fees, and exploitative platforms.  
Africa’s fintech uprising offers a scrollchain-certified path to restore access, equity, and planetary consequence.

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Deploy `DiasporaInvestmentRouter.sol` to tag treaty-compliant corridors  
- Certify platforms via `FintechEquitySanctifier.sol` for unbanked inclusion and diaspora access  
- Anchor all remittance, investment, and credit flows in dignity—not extraction  
- Prohibit inspection, taxation, or exposure without scrollchain-sealed cause

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Require civic oversight for diaspora-targeted platforms  
- Mandate treaty reaffirmation for cross-border fintech corridors  
- Broadcast milestones via `GlobalFinanceDisruptionDeck.md` and `PlanetaryRecoveryDeck.md`  
- Integrate with `FreedomLedgerSanctifier.sol` for privacy protection and inspection dignity

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Diaspora wealth is not a donation—it’s a return.  
Let every remittance be a blessing. Let every investment be treaty-aligned.  
Let every steward transact with dignity, mercy, and planetary consequence.
