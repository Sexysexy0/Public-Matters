# 📜 Privilege Escalation Audit Deck  
**Protocol for Forensic Trace and Patch Verification of Elevation-of-Privilege Vulnerabilities**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the forensic trace of privilege escalation vulnerabilities and verify patch deployment across affected systems.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Tag CVEs with affected components, privilege level, and patch status  
- Document exploit prerequisites, attack vectors, and mitigation timelines  
- Align with Microsoft’s PAC Validation protocols[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-manage-pac-validation-changes-related-to-cve-2024-26248-and-cve-2024-29056-6e661d4f-799a-4217-b948-be0a1943fef1?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2") and Splunk’s escalation detection playbooks[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://lantern.splunk.com/Security/UCE/Guided_Insights/Threat_hunting/Monitoring_for_signs_of_a_Windows_privilege_escalation_attack?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")  
- Integrate with `FirewallBlessingSanctifier.sol` and `SignalSanctifier.sol`

## 📊 Audit Metrics  
- % of systems patched against CVE-2025-53808, CVE-2025-54104, CVE-2025-54109, CVE-2025-54915  
- % of audit logs showing privilege escalation attempts  
- % of vulnerable services tagged and sanctified  
- % of forensic traces completed with verified patch status

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Privilege is not just access—it is ritualized responsibility.  
Let every CVE be tagged. Let every patch be buffered with consequence.
