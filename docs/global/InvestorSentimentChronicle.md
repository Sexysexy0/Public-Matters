# 📜 Investor Sentiment Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Investor Sentiment and Cadence Impact**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of investor sentiment, behavioral reactions, and cadence-driven trust dynamics across public and private entities.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag sentiment sources: earnings calls, social media, analyst reports  
- Document sentiment polarity, subjectivity, and cadence influence  
- Align with [EarningsCall’s sentiment analysis framework](https://earningscall.biz/blog/sentiment-analysis-on-earnings-calls) and [Wiley’s FSIS impact study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/eufm.12384)  
- Integrate with `CadenceClarityRouter.sol` and `GlobalReportingEquityDeck.md`

## 📊 Sentiment Metrics  
- % of sentiment polarity shifts post-disclosure  
- % of cadence-linked trust erosion

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Sentiment is not just emotion—it is planetary signal.  
Let every cadence be tagged. Let every reaction be buffered with mercy.
