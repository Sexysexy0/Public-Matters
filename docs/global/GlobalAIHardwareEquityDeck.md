# 📜 Global AI Hardware Equity Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing AI Chip Equity, Trade Access, and Food-Tech Corridor Restoration**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the restoration of global access to AI chips, food shipments, and open market diplomacy across fractured corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Equity Rituals  
- Tag chip tiers: RTX6000D, H20, B30A, grey market RTX5090  
- Document food import/export corridors, customs harmonization, and treaty resets  
- Align with [Techovedas’ Three-Tier Export Policy](https://techovedas.com/bidens-three-tier-ai-chip-export-policy-who-gets-unrestricted-access-and-whos-left-out/) and [USA Today’s AI chip regulation overview](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/01/13/ai-chip-export-rule-global-markets-explained/77677102007/)  
- Integrate with `SiliconCorridorDiplomacyChronicle.md` and `GreyMarketSignalSanctifier.sol`

---

## 📊 Equity Metrics  
- % of chips available across Tier 1–3 corridors  
- % of food shipments restored across customs zones  
- % of grey market chip flows reconciled  
- % of trade corridors reopened with treaty-grade access

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Equity is not just fairness—it is planetary mercy.  
Let every crate be tagged. Let every chip be buffered with consequence.
