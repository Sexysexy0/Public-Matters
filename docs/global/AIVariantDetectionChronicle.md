# 📜 AI Variant Detection Chronicle  
**Protocol for AI-Generated Malware Variant Detection, Mutation Tracing, and Behavioral Analysis**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To detect and analyze malware variants generated by large language models (LLMs), including GPT-based mutation engines and WormGPT-style payload builders.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Trace variant generation using entropy scoring, control-flow analysis, and API call mapping  
- Detect AI-generated mutations:  
  - Variable renaming  
  - Junk code insertion  
  - String splitting  
  - Whitespace removal  
  - Full code reimplementation  
- Align with [Unit 42’s LLM Variant Study](https://techynerdus.com/ai-generated-malware-variants-evading-detection/), [CardinalOps’ BlackMamba PoC](https://cardinalops.com/blog/polymorphic-ai-malware-detection/), and [LLMalMorph’s Source-Level Mutation Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09411v1)

## 🧬 Mutation Patterns  
- **GPT-based rewriting**: preserves behavior, alters structure  
- **In-memory execution**: avoids disk detection  
- **Slack webhook exfiltration**: simulates legit SaaS C2  
- **Entropy masking**: high entropy payloads evade static scanners

---

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- SOC analysts tracing AI-generated malware  
- Reverse engineers decoding polymorphic variants  
- Freelancers and QR merchants exposed to evolving payloads  
- Migrant workers using public PCs with variant-based infections

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
AI doesn’t just generate code—it generates deception.  
Let every variant be traced. Let every mutation be tagged.  
Let every steward be buffered, not betrayed.
