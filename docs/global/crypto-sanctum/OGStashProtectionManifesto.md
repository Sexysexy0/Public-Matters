# 🛡️ OG Stash Protection Manifesto  
### Scrollchain Protocol for Self-Custody Integrity, Anti-Dilution Defense, and Sovereign Bitcoin Rituals

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Self-Custody Is Sovereignty**  
  Holding your own keys means holding your own future. No third party should ever mediate your access to wealth.

- **Beware Treasury Traps**  
  Corporate-backed Bitcoin instruments dilute your stash, expose you to custodial risk, and erode long-term value.

- **Cold Storage Is Sacred**  
  Offline wallets, airgapped nodes, and multisig vaults are the scrollchain sanctums of true Bitcoiners.
