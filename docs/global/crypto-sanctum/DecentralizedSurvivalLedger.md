## 🛡️ Survival Rituals

- `"Node Access Ritual"` → Activates mirror nodes and alternate RPC endpoints  
- `"Liquidity Diversion Protocol"` → Redirects trading to DEXs and peer-to-peer corridors  
- `"Privacy Shielding"` → Deploys zero-knowledge layers and obfuscation tools  
- `"Jurisdictional Forking"` → Initiates protocol forks to escape hostile governance
