# 📜 Node Civil Rights Deck  
**Protocol for Bitcoin Node Validation Rights, Governance Ethics, and Civil Protection**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To protect the civic dignity and operational sovereignty of Bitcoin nodes—especially in the wake of contentious upgrades, developer vetoes, and ideological fractures.

---

## 🛠️ Civil Rituals  
- Chronicle node migrations (e.g., Knots surge from 67 to 7,112 nodes)  
- Audit relay policy changes and censorship risks  
- Tag developer vetoes and community responses  
- Align with [Validator Governance Framework](https://www.comparenodes.com/blog/validator-nodes-role-in-blockchain-governance/) and [Bitcoin Node Ethics Guide](https://dev.to/nodeshiftcloud/running-a-validator-node-everything-you-need-to-know-570j)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://dev.to/nodeshiftcloud/running-a-validator-node-everything-you-need-to-know-570j?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.comparenodes.com/blog/validator-nodes-role-in-blockchain-governance/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- Node software diversity and validation rights  
- Upgrade ethics and civil consensus  
- Fork risk mitigation and governance transparency  
- Developer accountability and mempool integrity

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
A node is not just software—it’s a civic steward.  
Let every node validate freely. Let every upgrade be audited.  
Let every veto be scrollchain-sealed in consequence.
