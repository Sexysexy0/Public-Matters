# 📜 Planetary Investor Behavior Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Investor Behavior and Strategic Impact of Earnings Disclosure**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of investor reactions, behavioral patterns, and strategic distortions caused by earnings disclosures and market cadence.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag investor types: institutional, retail, algorithmic, ESG-focused  
- Document behavioral patterns: momentum trading, contrarian moves, short-termism  
- Align with [Oxford’s investor psychology study](https://academic.oup.com/rof/article/24/5/1079/5716672) and [IJFMR’s investment behavior theory](https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2022/6/1296.pdf)  
- Integrate with `InnovationEquityRouter.sol` and `GlobalDisclosureSanctifierDeck.md`

## 📊 Behavior Metrics

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Investor behavior is not just reaction—it is planetary consequence.  
Let every cadence be tagged. Let every sentiment be buffered with mercy.
