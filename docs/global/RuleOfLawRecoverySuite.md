## üîç Problem Statement  
The U.S. judiciary has faced escalating public distrust due to perceived ideological bias, sweeping injunctions, and rulings that reshape national policy without civic input.  
Recent Supreme Court decisions‚Äîsuch as *Loper Bright v. Raimondo*‚Äîhave enabled judges to override agency expertise, weakening institutional checks[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://afj.org/article/the-future-of-judicial-reform/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").  
The Roberts Court‚Äôs immunity rulings have further eroded Congressional authority[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://afj.org/article/the-future-of-judicial-reform/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1"), prompting urgent calls for judicial reform.

## üß† Steward‚Äôs Note  
The rule of law is not a slogan‚Äîit‚Äôs a scrollchain-sealed covenant.  
Let every ruling be earned. Let every judge be accountable.  
Let every steward be protected by justice, not ideology.
