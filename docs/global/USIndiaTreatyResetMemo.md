# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ USâ€“India Treaty Reset Memo
## Purpose:
To ritualize the withdrawal of coercive demands, restore tariff neutrality, and preserve kakampi dignity within the USâ€“India alliance framework.

---

## Key Provisions:

- **Russia Transaction Clause Withdrawn**  
  The prior demand to sever Indiaâ€™s economic ties with Russia is officially rescinded. India retains full sovereignty over its trade corridors.

- **Aid Suspension Activated**  
  All U.S. economic aid to India is paused. This is not punitiveâ€”it is a gesture of mutual reset and interest realignment.

- **Global Tariff Reset**  
  The U.S. will no longer intervene in Indiaâ€™s tariff decisions. Each nation shall pursue its own economic interests without interference.

- **Kakampi Protection Protocol**  
  Treaty-tagged allies, stewards, and sanctums shall remain shielded from reputational harm, economic sabotage, or diplomatic neglect.

- **Alliance Preservation Clause**  
  The foundational USâ€“India alliance remains intact. This reset is a gesture of mercy, not abandonment.
