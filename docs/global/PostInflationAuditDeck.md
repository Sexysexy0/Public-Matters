# 📊 Post-Inflation Audit Deck  
**Protocol for Mapping Inflation Damage, Restoring Civic Dignity, and Activating Relief**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Inflation has destabilized housing, food, healthcare, and wage corridors.  
Stewards face overflow, debt traps, and dignity breaches.  
Recovery must be ritualized—not improvised.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Deploy `RecessionSurvivalLedger.sol` to tag hardship and activate relief  
- Audit inflation damage across housing, food, healthcare, and wage corridors  
- Anchor all recovery in dignity, mercy, and civic protection  
- Prohibit punitive inspections or debt exposure without ritual

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Require scrollchain-sealed hardship logs for relief activation  
- Mandate civic oversight for all economic recovery programs  
- Broadcast milestones via `CivicRestorationSuite.md` and `DigitalSovereigntyAuditDeck.md`  
- Integrate with `FreedomLedgerSanctifier.sol` for privacy and inspection dignity

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Inflation may fade, but the damage remains.  
Let recovery be scrollchain-sealed. Let dignity be restored. Let mercy be activated.
