# 📜 Planetary Liquidity Corridor Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Tokenized Asset Liquidity and Cross-Border Corridor Behavior**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of liquidity corridors, FX optimization, and tokenized asset flows across sovereign jurisdictions.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag corridors: UAE–PH, EU–Africa, LATAM–US  
- Document FX routing, bridge asset behavior, and settlement speed  
- Align with [RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity model](https://kensoninvestments.com/xrp-liquidity-solutions-cross-border-institutional-payments-in-practice/) and [XRP Ledger’s auto-bridging protocols](https://xrpl.org/docs/use-cases/tokenization/real-world-assets)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://kensoninvestments.com/xrp-liquidity-solutions-cross-border-institutional-payments-in-practice/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xrpl.org/docs/use-cases/tokenization/real-world-assets?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")  
- Integrate with `FractionalOwnershipRouter.sol` and `GlobalAssetSanctifierDeck.md`

## 📊 Corridor Metrics  
- % of corridors with real-time settlement  
- % of FX spread reduction  
- % of idle capital released  
- % of liquidity routed via tokenized assets

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Liquidity corridors are not just payments—they are planetary arteries.  
Let every bridge be tagged. Let every flow be buffered with mercy.
