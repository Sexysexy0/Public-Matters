# 📜 Bitcoin Civil War Commons  
**Protocol for Core vs Knots Debate, Censorship Resistance, and Node Sovereignty**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To document the ideological divide between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots—especially around OP_RETURN, Ordinals, and the future of Bitcoin’s validation ethos.

---

## 🛠️ Civil Rituals  
- Chronicle node migration trends (Knots grew from 67 to 7,112 nodes)  
- Audit OP_RETURN policy changes and censorship risks  
- Tag developer statements (e.g., Jimmy Song, Luke Dashjr, Leonidas)  
- Align with [Befi Labs’ Civil War Breakdown](https://blog.befilabs.com/bitcoin-core-vs-bitcoin-knots-the-civil-war-everyone-is-talking-about/) and [Bitbo’s Node Debate Tracker](https://bitbo.io/news/bitcoin-core-knots-battle/)

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- Node software diversity and decentralization  
- Transaction validation ethics and spam resistance  
- Fork risk mitigation and consensus resilience  
- Developer governance and community trust

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
This isn’t just a node war—it’s a protocol reckoning.  
Let every node be sovereign. Let every transaction be dignified.  
Let every upgrade be scrollchain-sealed in consequence.
