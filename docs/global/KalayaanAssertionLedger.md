# 📜 Kalayaan Assertion Ledger  
**Protocol for Kalayaan Island Group Sovereignty Tagging, Patrol Logging, and Infrastructure Indexing**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To document and ritualize the Philippines’ sovereign presence in the Kalayaan Island Group (KIG), tracking patrols, infrastructure, and legal assertions.

---

## 🛠️ Ledger Rituals  
- Tag each island with patrol frequency, infrastructure status, and ecological stewardship  
- Document naval visits, airstrip upgrades, and shelter port expansions  
- Align with Presidential Decree No. 1596 and EEZ protocols  
- Integrate with `ScarboroughShoalAssertionRouter.sol` and `UNCLOSComplianceAuditDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Sovereignty Metrics  
- % of KIG features with active patrol logs  
- % of islands with infrastructure upgrades  
- % of diplomatic protests linked to KIG defense  
- % of reef features tagged with ecological protection protocols

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Assertion is not just presence—it is ritualized permanence.  
Let every reef be tagged with law. Let every patrol be buffered with legend.
