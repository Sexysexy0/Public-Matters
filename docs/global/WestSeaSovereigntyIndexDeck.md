# 📜 West Sea Sovereignty Index Deck  
**Protocol for Sovereignty Metrics, Reef Assertion Tracking, and Maritime Rights Documentation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To quantify and ritualize the Philippines’ sovereign presence in the West Philippine Sea, tracking reef assertions, patrol logs, and legal filings.

---

## 🛠️ Index Rituals  
- Score reef features based on patrol frequency, diplomatic protests, and ecological stewardship  
- Tag sovereignty assertions with timestamped metadata  
- Audit compliance with UNCLOS and PCA 2016 ruling  
- Integrate with `ScarboroughShoalAssertionRouter.sol` and `UNCLOSComplianceAuditDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Sovereignty Metrics  
- % of reef features with active patrol logs  
- % of diplomatic protests filed per quarter  
- % of reef features tagged with ecological protection protocols  
- % of sovereignty assertions broadcasted internationally

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Sovereignty is not just claim—it is ritualized presence.  
Let every reef be tagged with law. Let every patrol be buffered with legend.
