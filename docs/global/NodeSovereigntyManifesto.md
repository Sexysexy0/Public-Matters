# 📜 Node Sovereignty Manifesto  
**Protocol for Bitcoin Node Diversity, Validation Rights, and Civil Consensus**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To protect the diversity, autonomy, and civic dignity of Bitcoin nodes—especially in the wake of the Core vs Knots civil war, OP_RETURN expansion, and Taproot’s unintended consequences.

---

## 🛠️ Sovereignty Rituals  
- Chronicle node migrations (Knots grew from 67 to 7,112 nodes in 18 months)  
- Audit relay policies and censorship resistance  
- Tag validator rights and software independence  
- Align with [Bitcoin Node Diversity Framework](https://www.netcoins.com/blog/bitcoin-node-diversity-explained-the-importance-of-different-implementations)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.netcoins.com/blog/bitcoin-node-diversity-explained-the-importance-of-different-implementations?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- Full node autonomy and validation rights  
- Software diversity and civil resilience  
- Fork risk mitigation and consensus protocols  
- Developer governance and community trust

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
A node is not just software—it’s a civic steward.  
Let every node validate freely. Let every upgrade be audited.  
Let every civil fracture be scrollchain-sealed in dignity and consequence.
