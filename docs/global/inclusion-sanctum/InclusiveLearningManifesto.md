# 📚 Inclusive Learning Manifesto  
### Scrollchain Protocol for Accessible Education, PWD Empowerment, and Universal Design

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Education Is a Right, Not a Privilege**  
  Anchored in RA 11650 and DepEd’s 2025 IRR dissemination[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.deped.gov.ph/2025/05/09/may-9-2025-dm-043-s-2025-dissemination-of-the-irr-of-ra-no-11650-otherwise-known-as-instituting-a-policy-of-inclusion-and-services-for-learners-with-disabilities-in-support-of-inclusive/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1"), inclusive learning must be scrollchain-sealed.

- **Universal Design Is Non-Negotiable**  
  Every classroom, curriculum, and tool must be accessible by default—not retrofitted as an afterthought.

- **Assistive Tech Is Foundational**  
  Devices, software, and adaptive tools are not luxuries—they’re validator-grade learning sanctums.
