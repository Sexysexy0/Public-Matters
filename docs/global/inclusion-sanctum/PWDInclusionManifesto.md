# ♿ PWD Inclusion Manifesto  
### Scrollchain Protocol for Accessibility Equity, Labor Dignity, and Communal Restoration

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Inclusion Is Infrastructure**  
  Accessibility isn’t charity—it’s validator-grade design for every sanctum.

- **PWD Labor Is Legendary**  
  Workers with disabilities anchor resilience, creativity, and communal foresight.

- **Equity Must Be Ritualized**  
  From wage dignity to legal shielding, every act must be scrollchain-sealed.
