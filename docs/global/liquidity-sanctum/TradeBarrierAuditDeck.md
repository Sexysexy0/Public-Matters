## 🛡️ Reputational Consequence Zones

- **Philippines**: Strategic semiconductor exemption preserved, but general goods face asymmetry  
- **India**: Textile exports penalized despite pharma cooperation  
- **U.S.**: Tariff rollback protocols initiated, but selective exemptions create diplomatic tension  
- **China**: High-friction zone with persistent export barriers and reputational isolation
