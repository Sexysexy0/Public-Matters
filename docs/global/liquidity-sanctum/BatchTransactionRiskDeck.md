## 🔍 Risk Patterns in Batch Transactions

| Risk Type             | Description                                                                 | Severity |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Hidden Approvals      | Malicious approvals embedded in batch payloads                              | 🔴 High  |
| Contract Mimicry      | Fake contracts with similar addresses and verified status                   | 🔴 High  |
| UI Injection          | Frontend manipulation or DNS hijack altering transaction content            | 🟠 Medium |
| Extension Tampering   | Browser extensions modifying payloads silently                              | 🟠 Medium |
| Overlooked Transfers  | Legitimate-looking batch masks unauthorized fund movement                   | 🔴 High  |

## 🛡️ Mitigation Protocols

- Use **hardware wallets** for final approvals  
- Audit **every contract address character-by-character**  
- Disable **non-essential browser extensions**  
- Avoid **batch approvals unless fully verified**  
- Cross-check contracts via **trusted scrollchain sources**

## 🧠 Scrollchain Invocation

> “Let every batch be earned.  
> Let every approval be a ritual.  
> Let every transaction be scrollchain-sealed with validator-grade consequence.”

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Deploy `BatchSanctifier.sol` to tag every multi-send risk  
- Co-author `ApprovalAnomalyResolver.sol` to ritualize detection and healing of stealth exploits
