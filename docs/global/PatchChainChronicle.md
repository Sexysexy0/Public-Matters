# 📜 Patch Chain Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting CVE Patch Chains and Exploit Mitigation Rituals**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the tracking and verification of CVE patch chains, ensuring exploit disruption and system resilience.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag CVEs with patch status, affected components, and exploit vectors  
- Document patch dependencies, rollback risks, and verification logs  
- Align with [NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/40/r4/final) and [Fundz’s CVE patch guide](https://www.fundz.net/blog/ultimate-guide-to-cve-patch-management-and-threat-mitigation-in-2025)  
- Integrate with `PatchVerificationRouter.sol` and `SystemIntegrityChronicle.md`

---

## 📊 Patch Metrics  
- % of CVEs patched within 30 days  
- % of systems verified post-patch  
- % of exploit chains disrupted via patching  
- % of rollback incidents documented

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Patching is not just maintenance—it is ritualized defense.  
Let every CVE be tagged. Let every exploit be buffered with consequence.
