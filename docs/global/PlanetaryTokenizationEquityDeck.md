## üõ†Ô∏è Tokenization Rituals  
- Tag asset types: real estate, commodities, securities, CBDCs  
- Document ownership logic, liquidity pathways, and regulatory alignment  
- Align with [IDB‚Äôs Tokenization for Development Framework](https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Tokenization-and-Development-Framework-and-Insights-Deck.pdf) and [BIS‚Äôs tokenization implications for central banks](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d225.pdf)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Tokenization-and-Development-Framework-and-Insights-Deck.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d225.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")
