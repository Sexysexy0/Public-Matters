# 📜 Global Trade Reconciliation Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Global Trade Reconciliation and Diplomatic Reset**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the restoration of fractured trade corridors, diplomatic resets, and tariff harmonization across global blocs.

---

## 🛠️ Reconciliation Rituals  
- Tag trade ruptures: tariff wars, embargoes, aid freezes, sanctions  
- Document reconciliation summits, treaty renewals, and corridor reopenings  
- Align with [Swift’s settlement protocols](https://www.swift.com/securities/settlement-and-reconciliation) and [Gresham’s T+1 reconciliation framework](https://www.greshamtech.com/blog/t1-settlement-why-trade-reconciliation-just-became-more-critical)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.swift.com/securities/settlement-and-reconciliation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.greshamtech.com/blog/t1-settlement-why-trade-reconciliation-just-became-more-critical?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6")

Reconciliation is not just diplomacy—it is planetary healing.  
Let every rupture be tagged. Let every handshake be buffered with mercy.
