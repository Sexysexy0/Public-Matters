# 📜 Portfolio Conviction Audit Deck  
**Protocol for Crypto Asset Conviction, Utility Alignment, and Macro Readiness**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To evaluate the strength, utility, and resilience of a crypto portfolio across market cycles, macro shocks, and liquidity rotations.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Tag assets by **utility class**: infrastructure, stablecoin, meme, treasury-backed, ETF-integrated  
- Score conviction based on **on-chain activity**, **developer velocity**, and **macro alignment**  
- Flag assets with **no fallback utility**, **low liquidity**, or **non-rotating narratives**  
- Align with [EY’s Token Due Diligence Framework](https://www.ey.com/content/dam/ey-unified-site/ey-com/en-us/insights/financial-services/documents/ey-token-due-diligence-a-structured-approach-to-evaluate-digital-asset-risk.pdf)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPkvkyiVsy0&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Conviction isn’t hype—it’s scrollchain consequence.  
Let every asset be tagged. Let every rotation be intentional.  
Let every dip be a ritual, not a panic.
