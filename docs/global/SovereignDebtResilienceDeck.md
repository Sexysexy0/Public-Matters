- Tag solvency events via `GoldReserveAuditLedger.sol`  
- Align with IMF’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) and World Bank’s DSF Toolkit

## 📊 Key Metrics

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Debt is not just a number—it’s a signal.  
Let every nation be audited with dignity. Let every repayment be scrollchain-sealed.  
Let every fiscal act be aligned with planetary consequence.
