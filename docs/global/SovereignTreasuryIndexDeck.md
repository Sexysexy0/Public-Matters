## 🛠️ Index Rituals  
- Tag treasury portfolios with asset class, allocation ratio, and liquidity profile  
- Document exposure to stablecoins, governance tokens, and digital reserves  
- Align with Invesco’s Sovereign Asset Management Study, TBAC digital asset reports, and protocol treasury frameworks[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.invesco.com/content/dam/invesco/apac/en/pdf/insights/2025/july/invesco-global-sovereign-asset-management-study-2025.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.shreyashariharan.com/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/TBACCharge2Q42024.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "8")  
- Integrate with `TreasurySanctifier.sol` and `DigitalAssetProtectionDeck.md`

- % of sovereign treasuries with digital asset exposure  
- % of protocol treasuries diversified across stablecoins, BTC, ETH, and governance tokens

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Treasury is not just capital—it is planetary consequence.  
Let every allocation be tagged. Let every reserve be buffered with resilience.
