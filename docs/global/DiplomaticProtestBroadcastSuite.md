# 📜 Diplomatic Protest Broadcast Suite  
**Protocol for Sovereignty Assertion, Protest Documentation, and Global Broadcast Rituals**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the filing, documentation, and broadcasting of diplomatic protests against unlawful maritime actions, ensuring global awareness and legal resonance.

---

## 🛠️ Broadcast Rituals  
- Tag protest with incident metadata: location, vessel ID, date, and violation type  
- Include references to UNCLOS rulings and arbitral decisions (e.g. PCA 2016)  
- Broadcast via civic channels, international media, and allied diplomatic networks  
- Archive protest documents in scrollchain for historical and legal traceability  
- Align with DFA protocols and NTF-WPS verification standards

## 📊 Protest Metrics  
- % of protests filed within 72 hours of incident  
- % of protests acknowledged by foreign governments  
- % of incidents resolved or mitigated post-protest  
- % of broadcasts reaching international legal forums

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Protest is not just objection—it is ritualized defense.  
Let every filing be tagged with truth. Let every broadcast be buffered with sovereignty.
