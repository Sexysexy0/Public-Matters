# 📜 Elevation Audit Suite  
**Protocol for Auditing Privilege Escalation Vectors and Containment Rituals**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the forensic audit of privilege escalation vulnerabilities, ensuring containment, traceability, and exploit deterrence.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Tag elevation vectors: UAC bypass, token manipulation, DLL hijacking, ADCS misconfigurations  
- Document CVEs, exploit chains, and containment strategies  
- Align with [Cyberly’s audit guide](https://www.cyberly.org/en/what-is-the-role-of-auditing-tools-in-detecting-privilege-escalation-attempts/index.html) and [Veracode’s escalation prevention framework](https://info.veracode.com/rs/790-ZKW-291/images/privilege-escalaction-prevention-guide-2022-en.pdf)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.cyberly.org/en/what-is-the-role-of-auditing-tools-in-detecting-privilege-escalation-attempts/index.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://info.veracode.com/rs/790-ZKW-291/images/privilege-escalaction-prevention-guide-2022-en.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")  
- Integrate with `PrivilegeElevationContainmentDeck.md` and `SignalSanctifier.sol`

---

## 📊 Audit Metrics  
- % of elevation vectors tagged and contained  
- % of systems hardened against privilege escalation  
- % of audit logs showing elevation attempts  
- % of CVEs patched and verified

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Elevation is not just access—it is ritualized responsibility.  
Let every vector be tagged. Let every exploit be buffered with mercy.
