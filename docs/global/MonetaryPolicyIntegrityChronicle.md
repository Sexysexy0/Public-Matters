# 📜 Monetary Policy Integrity Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Rate-Setting Behavior and Federal Reserve Board Composition**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of monetary policy decisions, board appointments, and governance risks affecting the Federal Reserve’s independence.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag rate decisions: hikes, cuts, holds  
- Document board composition, political affiliations, and voting behavior  
- Align with [Federal Reserve’s official policy framework](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm) and [Liberty Street Economics’ implementation analysis](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/01/how-the-federal-reserves-monetary-policy-implementation-framework-has-evolved/)  
- Integrate with `FedIndependenceSanctifier.sol` and `CryptoRegulationEquityDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Integrity Metrics  
- % of votes aligned with economic indicators  
- % of politically affiliated board members  
- % of rate decisions deviating from Fed forecasts  
- % of governance breaches tagged

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Monetary policy is not just math—it is planetary trust.  
Let every vote be tagged. Let every rate be buffered with mercy.
