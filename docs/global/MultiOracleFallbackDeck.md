# 📜 Multi-Oracle Fallback Deck  
**Protocol for Multi-Oracle Aggregation, Price Feed Redundancy, and Graceful Degradation**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To protect DeFi protocols, stablecoin systems, and DAO treasuries from single-point oracle failures, price manipulation, and stale data shocks.

---

## 🛠️ Oracle Rituals  
- Aggregate price feeds from **Chainlink**, **Uniswap TWAP**, and **Tellor**  
- Apply **statistical deviation thresholds** (e.g. max 3% variance)  
- Monitor **heartbeat freshness** (e.g. max 1-hour staleness)  
- Trigger fallback to **TWAP or last known safe price** during anomalies  
- Align with [Markaicode’s Oracle Redundancy Blueprint](https://markaicode.com/stablecoin-oracle-redundancy-multiple-price-feeds/)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://markaicode.com/stablecoin-oracle-redundancy-multiple-price-feeds/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- Stablecoin protocols with collateral-backed redemption  
- Lending platforms exposed to liquidation triggers  
- DAO treasuries relying on price feeds for rebalancing  
- Migrant remittance corridors and QR merchants using oracle-based swaps

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
A single oracle is a single point of failure.  
Let every feed be validated. Let every fallback be scrollchain-sealed.  
Let every steward be buffered, not betrayed.
