# 📜 Protocol Liquidity Sanctifier  
**Protocol for Ensuring Protocol Treasury Liquidity, Yield Optimization, and Fiscal Resilience**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the liquidity management of protocol treasuries, ensuring operational continuity, yield optimization, and defensive allocation.

---

## 🛠️ Liquidity Rituals  
- Tag treasury assets with liquidity profile, yield source, and withdrawal latency  
- Document allocation ratios across stablecoins, governance tokens, RWAs  
- Align with Uniswap, Compound, and [DeFi treasury contracts](https://github.com/mohitchandel/treasury-contract)  
- Integrate with `TreasurySanctifier.sol` and `ProtocolTreasuryDiversificationDeck.md`

## 📊 Liquidity Metrics  
- % of assets in liquid pools vs locked staking  
- % of treasury yield generated monthly  
- % of emergency withdrawal latency  
- % of assets covered by insurance or circuit breakers

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Liquidity is not just access—it is planetary resilience.  
Let every pool be tagged. Let every downturn be buffered with mercy.
