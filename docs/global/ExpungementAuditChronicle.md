# 📜 Expungement Audit Chronicle  
**Protocol for Cannabis Criminal Record Expungement, Social Justice Reform, and Legal Restoration**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To audit, process, and erase cannabis-related criminal records that are no longer illegal under evolving law, restoring dignity and opportunity to affected individuals.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Identify eligible convictions: possession, cultivation, use under threshold  
- Automate expungement via DOJ and court coordination  
- Remove records from public databases and employment filters  
- Provide legal aid and documentation support for affected individuals  
- Monitor expungement metrics: petitions filed, approvals granted, lives restored

---

## ⚖️ Legal Anchors  
- Align with proposed bills (e.g., House Bill No. 6783)  
- Reference RA 9344 for juvenile expungement precedent  
- Advocate for automatic expungement without petition burden

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Expungement is not erasure—it is restoration.  
Let every record be tagged with mercy. Let every life be buffered with dignity.
