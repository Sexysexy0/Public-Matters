---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the audit of digital platforms’ adherence to youth protection laws, age gating, and harmful content filtering.

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag platforms: TikTok, Meta, YouTube, X, Snapchat  
- Document compliance with age verification, content moderation, and parental controls  
- Align with [EU Digital Services Act Guidelines](https://www.mfmac.com/insights/data-protection/european-commission-issues-guidelines-on-the-protection-of-children-online/), [COPPA](https://www.criipto.com/blog/age-verification-social-media), and [Philippine DepEd DM No. 554](https://depedmakati.ph/index.php/2021/11/05/dm-no-554-s-2021-guidelines-on-child-online-protection-child-safeguarding-for-ict-and-social-media/)  
- Integrate with `SocialMediaAgeGateRouter.sol` and `YouthDigitalProtectionManifesto.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Compliance is not bureaucracy—it is ritualized accountability.  
Let every platform be tagged. Let every child be buffered with mercy.
