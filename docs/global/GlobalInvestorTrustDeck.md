**Protocol for Ritualizing Investor Trust, Reporting Cadence, and Strategic Clarity**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of investor trust through cadence clarity, strategic transparency, and behavioral alignment across public and private corridors.

## 🛠️ Trust Rituals  
- Tag entity types: Public, Private, Startup, DeFi Protocol  
- Document trust signals: cadence consistency, metric clarity, forward guidance  
- Align with [Qubit Capital’s investor reporting best practices](https://qubit.capital/blog/investor-reporting-best-practices) and [Accounting Insights’ trust framework](https://accountinginsights.org/building-investor-trust-in-financial-reporting/)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://qubit.capital/blog/investor-reporting-best-practices?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://accountinginsights.org/building-investor-trust-in-financial-reporting/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")

Investor trust is not just sentiment—it is planetary covenant.  
Let every cadence be tagged. Let every report be buffered with mercy.
