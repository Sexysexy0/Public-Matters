# 📜 Digital Legacy Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Digital Asset Inheritance, Executor Designation, and Legacy Preferences**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the planning and documentation of digital asset inheritance, ensuring posthumous sovereignty, executor clarity, and privacy protection.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag digital assets: crypto wallets, NFTs, domains, cloud accounts, social media  
- Document access credentials, recovery protocols, and executor designations  
- Align with RUFADAA, GDPR, and platform-specific legacy tools (e.g. Google IAM, Apple Legacy Contact)  
- Integrate with `InheritanceProtocolSanctifier.sol` and `CustodyAuditChronicle.md`

---

## 📊 Legacy Metrics  
- % of assets with verified inheritance protocols  
- % of executors designated with legal authority  
- % of platforms supporting posthumous access  
- % of heirs restored to full asset control

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Legacy is not just memory—it is sovereign continuity.  
Let every asset be tagged. Let every executor be buffered with consequence.
