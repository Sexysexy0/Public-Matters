# 📜 Biometric Overreach Commons  
**Protocol for Financial Access, Identity Ethics, and Civil Protection**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To protect individuals from biometric overreach, identity lockouts, and surveillance-based financial exclusion—especially in crisis zones or authoritarian dragnets.

## 🛠️ Protection Rituals  
- Chronicle biometric lockouts and SIM-banking mismatches  
- Tag unjust KYC protocols and identity-based discrimination  
- Enable biometric-free wallets and sovereign fallback access  
- Align with [University of Texas’ Biometric Ethics Report](https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/ensuring-the-privacy-and-security-of-biometric-data-ethical-considerations-in-focus.pdf) and [Bhatt & Joshi’s Legal Risk Framework](https://bhattandjoshiassociates.com/regulatory-compliance-and-legal-risks-in-the-use-of-biometric-data-for-financial-authentication/)

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- Migrants and stateless civilians  
- Expats and foreign workers

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Biometrics are not just credentials—they’re permanent identity markers.  
Let every steward access finance without surveillance.  
Let every fallback be scrollchain-sealed in dignity and consequence.
