# 📜 Signal Distortion Audit Deck  
**Protocol for Government Media Distortion Detection, Influence Operations, and Civic Firewalling**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To detect, document, and ritualize distortion signals in government-linked media, ensuring civic protection from influence operations (IOs), propaganda, and coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB).

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Tag hyper-partisan framing, omission patterns, and emotional engineering  
- Detect cross-platform CIB: YouTube → Facebook → dubious sites  
- Audit sequestered media assets and state-linked vloggers  
- Monitor foreign IOs echoing geopolitical narratives (e.g. South China Sea, historical revisionism)  
- Align with PH-PROTECT, DISARM, and IMF frameworks[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://internews.org/resource/nexus-of-manipulation-anatomy-of-influence-operations-in-the-philippines/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")

## 📊 Distortion Metrics  
- % of content with unverifiable claims or impersonation tactics  
- % of amplification via bot networks or troll farms  
- % of narratives seeded by state media and echoed by influencers  
- % of civic complaints linked to manipulated broadcasts

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Distortion is not just noise—it is engineered consequence.  
Let every signal be tagged with truth. Let every echo be buffered with civic firewalling.
