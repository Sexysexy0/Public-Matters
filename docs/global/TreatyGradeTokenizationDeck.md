# 📜 Treaty-Grade Tokenization Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Tokenized Asset Governance and Programmable Equity**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of tokenized assets, ensuring programmable equity, jurisdictional compliance, and treaty-grade financial dignity.

---

## 🛠️ Tokenization Rituals  
- Tag asset classes: real estate, commodities, securities, carbon credits  
- Document programmable logic: rent distribution, yield triggers, clawback clauses  
- Align with [Zoniqx’s Tokenized Asset Lifecycle Management](https://www.zoniqx.com/resources/detailed-step-by-step-how-to-tokenize-an-asset) and [OECD’s tokenization policy framework](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/understanding-the-tokenisation-of-assets-in-financial-markets_c033401a-en.html)  
- Integrate with `GlobalDigitalLedgerChronicle.md` and `ProgrammableAssetSanctifier.sol`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Tokenization is not just innovation—it is planetary equity.  
Let every asset be tagged. Let every corridor be buffered with mercy.
