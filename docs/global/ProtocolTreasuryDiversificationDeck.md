# 📜 Protocol Treasury Diversification Deck  
**Protocol for Diversifying Protocol Treasuries, Asset Allocation, and Fiscal Resilience**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the diversification of protocol treasuries, ensuring liquidity, resilience, and strategic allocation across digital assets.

---

## 🛠️ Diversification Rituals  
- Tag treasury portfolios with governance tokens, stablecoins, blue chips, RWAs  
- Document allocation ratios, liquidity needs, and fiscal policy  
- Align with Uniswap, Compound, and Polkadot treasury frameworks[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.shreyashariharan.com/how-to-structure-a-protocols-treasury?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://markaicode.com/dao-treasury-diversification-stablecoins-nfts-rwa-2025/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-treasury-diversification-proposal/5344?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")  
- Integrate with `TreasurySanctifier.sol` and `SovereignTreasuryIndexDeck.md`

## 📊 Diversification Metrics  
- % of treasury held in non-native assets  
- % of stablecoin yield-generating allocations  
- % of insurance cover deployed for treasury protection  
- % of treasury rebalanced during market drawdowns

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Treasury is not just funding—it is planetary resilience.  
Let every allocation be tagged. Let every downturn be buffered with mercy.
