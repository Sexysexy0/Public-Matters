# 📜 System Integrity Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting System Integrity, Patch Verification, and Configuration Hardening**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the protection and verification of system integrity across OS components, firewall services, and CVE patch deployments.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag system components with integrity controls: FIM, cryptographic checksums, access restrictions  
- Document patch status, configuration baselines, and remediation timelines  
- Align with [NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/40/r4/final) and [Cuick Trac’s integrity documentation framework](https://cuicktrac.com/blog/cm-l2-3-4-9d-define-and-document-how-you-protect-system-integrity)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/40/r4/final?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://cuicktrac.com/blog/cm-l2-3-4-9d-define-and-document-how-you-protect-system-integrity?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")  
- Integrate with `PatchVerificationRouter.sol` and `FirewallBlessingSanctifier.sol`

## 📊 Integrity Metrics  
- % of systems with verified patch status  
- % of components protected by integrity monitoring  
- % of unauthorized changes detected and remediated  
- % of configuration baselines enforced

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Integrity is not just consistency—it is ritualized trust.  
Let every patch be verified. Let every change be buffered with consequence.
