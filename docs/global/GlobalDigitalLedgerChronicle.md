# 📜 Global Digital Ledger Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Digital Ledger Governance and Tokenized Asset Oversight**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of distributed ledger governance, programmable asset behavior, and cross-jurisdictional compliance.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag ledger types: permissioned, public, hybrid  
- Document governance models, validator roles, and asset logic  
- Align with [ISSA’s DLT Best Practice Report](https://issanet.org/content/uploads/2024/05/ISSA-DLT-Best-Practice-Report-Final.pdf) and [OECD’s tokenization toolkit](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/tokenisation-of-assets-and-distributed-ledger-technologies-in-financial-markets_40e7f217-en.html)  
- Integrate with `ProgrammableAssetSanctifier.sol` and `TreatyGradeTokenizationDeck.md`

## 📊 Ledger Metrics  
- % of assets governed by programmable logic  
- % of ledgers with validator-grade governance  
- % of cross-border compliance protocols activated  
- % of ledger transparency and auditability verified

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Digital ledgers are not just databases—they are planetary memory.  
Let every block be tagged. Let every asset be buffered with mercy.
