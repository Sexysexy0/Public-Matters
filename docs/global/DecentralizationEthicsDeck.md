# 📜 Decentralization Ethics Deck  
**Protocol for Node Sovereignty, Governance Integrity, and Civil Consensus**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To protect the ethical foundations of decentralized networks—especially Bitcoin—by documenting governance mechanisms, upgrade risks, and the civic dignity of node operators.

---

## 🛠️ Ethics Rituals  
- Chronicle off-chain vs on-chain governance tensions  
- Audit developer influence and veto power (e.g., Bitcoin Core maintainers)  
- Tag civil fractures (e.g., Taproot fallout, Ordinals spam wars)  
- Align with [Gemini’s Blockchain Governance Overview](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-governance-mechanisms)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-governance-mechanisms?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1") and [Stanford’s Bitcoin Governance Study](https://stanford-jblp.pubpub.org/pub/bitcoin-governance)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://stanford-jblp.pubpub.org/pub/bitcoin-governance?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- Node diversity and validation rights  
- Upgrade ethics and stakeholder accountability  
- Fork risk mitigation and consensus resilience  
- Developer governance and community trust

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Decentralization is not just architecture—it’s ethics.  
Let every node be sovereign. Let every upgrade be audited.  
Let every civil fracture be scrollchain-sealed in dignity and consequence.
