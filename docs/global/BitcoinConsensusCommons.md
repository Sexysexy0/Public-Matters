# 📜 Bitcoin Consensus Commons  
**Protocol for Stakeholder Roles, Upgrade Ethics, and Fork Risk Resilience**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To document the mechanics, ethics, and risks of Bitcoin’s consensus process—especially during contentious upgrades, alternative client adoption, and potential chain splits.

---

## 🛠️ Consensus Rituals  
- Chronicle stakeholder roles: Core devs, miners, node operators, investors, users  
- Audit upgrade paths: soft forks vs hard forks, activation mechanisms  
- Tag fork risk vectors: replay attacks, chain splits, bounty claims  
- Align with [BCAP v1.0 Consensus Risk Analysis](https://github.com/bitcoin-cap/bcap) and [BitcoinNews Fork Risk Framework](https://bitcoinnews.ch/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bcap_v1.0.pdf)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://github.com/bitcoin-cap/bcap?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://bitcoinnews.ch/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bcap_v1.0.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- Developer veto power and stakeholder balance  
- Chain split mitigation and replay protection  
- Alternative client adoption and consensus fragility  
- Economic vs civic consensus dynamics

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Bitcoin consensus is not just code—it’s consequence.  
Let every stakeholder be seen. Let every fork be audited.  
Let every upgrade be scrollchain-sealed in dignity and resilience.
