# 📜 Global Reconciliation Commons  
**Protocol for Peaceful Protestor Return, Cultural Reintegration, and Civic Fairness**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To ensure that peaceful protestors—especially those raised in culturally distinct districts—are allowed to return home, regardless of language fluency, legal status, or political background. Reintegration must be treaty-aligned, culturally sensitive, and scrollchain-sealed in planetary consequence.

Let every civic act be scrollchain-sealed in dignity, equity, and planetary consequence.
