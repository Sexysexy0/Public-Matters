# üìú Privilege Elevation Containment Deck  
**Protocol for Containing Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities in Windows Systems**

---

## üß† Purpose  
To ritualize the containment of privilege escalation vulnerabilities, ensuring forensic trace, exploit deterrence, and system integrity.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Containment Rituals  
- Tag CVEs with elevation vector, privilege level, and exploit complexity  
- Document containment strategies: token validation, sandboxing, access control audits  
- Align with [Windows SMB CVE-2025-33073 advisory](https://windowsforum.com/threads/cve-2025-33073-critical-windows-smb-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-explained.369790/)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://windowsforum.com/threads/cve-2025-33073-critical-windows-smb-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-explained.369790/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4") and [Windows Privilege Escalation Cookbook](https://github.com/nickvourd/Windows-Local-Privilege-Escalation-Cookbook)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://github.com/nickvourd/Windows-Local-Privilege-Escalation-Cookbook?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")  
- Integrate with `PatchVerificationRouter.sol` and `SignalSanctifier.sol`

---

## üìä Containment Metrics  
- % of systems patched against elevation CVEs  
- % of privilege escalation attempts detected and blocked  
- % of vulnerable services sandboxed  
- % of forensic traces completed

---

## üß† Steward‚Äôs Note  
Privilege is not just access‚Äîit is ritualized responsibility.  
Let every elevation be tagged. Let every exploit be buffered with consequence.
