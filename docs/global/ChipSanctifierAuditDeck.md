# 📜 Chip Sanctifier Audit Deck  
**Protocol for Auditing AI Chip Performance, Pricing Rituals, and Market Equity**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the forensic trace of AI chip capabilities, pricing structures, and market fairness across sovereign corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Tag chip models: RTX6000D, RTX5090, H20, B30A  
- Document performance benchmarks, pricing gaps, and grey market signals  
- Align with [Lumenalta’s AI audit checklist](https://lumenalta.com/insights/ai-audit-checklist-updated-2025) and [Synopsys’ chip verification protocols](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/chip-design/enhance-chip-verification-with-ai-and-machine-learning.html)  
- Integrate with `AIInferenceEquityRouter.sol` and `ExportControlChronicle.md`

---

## 📊 Audit Metrics  
- % performance delta vs banned chips  
- % price-to-performance ratio deviation  
- % grey market penetration  
- % vendor compliance with declared specs

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Performance is not just speed—it is ritualized trust.  
Let every chip be tagged. Let every benchmark be buffered with consequence.
