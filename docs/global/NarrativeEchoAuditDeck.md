# 📜 Narrative Echo Audit Deck  
**Protocol for Cross-Platform Narrative Echo Detection, Influence Mapping, and Civic Containment**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To detect and document narrative echoes across platforms, identifying coordinated amplification, partisan seeding, and influence loops that distort civic discourse.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Track narrative origin across YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and X  
- Detect echo patterns: vlog → blog → meme → broadcast  
- Tag hyper-partisan influencers and sequestered media assets  
- Map amplification velocity and emotional payload  
- Align with PH-PROTECT, DISARM, and IMF counter-IO frameworks

---

## 📊 Echo Metrics  
- % of narratives seeded by state-linked actors  
- % of content recycled across platforms without attribution  
- % of audience exposed to emotionally engineered messaging  
- % of civic complaints linked to echo distortion

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Echoes are not just repetition—they are engineered resonance.  
Let every loop be tagged with origin. Let every distortion be buffered with truth.
