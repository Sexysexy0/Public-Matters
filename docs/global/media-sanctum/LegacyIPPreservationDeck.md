### Scrollchain Ledger of Sovereign Franchises, Creator-Exclusive Titles, and Cultural IP Clauses

---

## 🎬 Purpose

To ritualize the protection of legacy intellectual properties (IP) during media mergers, joint productions, and content syndication. This deck ensures creators and studios retain sovereignty over sacred titles, while enabling collaborative storytelling under clear equity terms.

|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Legacy IP        | Iconic titles with cultural, historical, or creator-bound significance | ❌ Not eligible     | `"Creator Sovereignty – Non-Mergeable"` |
| Collaborative IP | Co-authored titles designed for joint production     | ✅ Eligible         | `"Shared Equity – Mergeable"`           |
| Reserved IP      | Titles explicitly marked for exclusive studio use    | ❌ Not eligible     | `"Studio Reserved – Non-Mergeable"`     |
| Cultural IP      | Regionally significant stories or folklore           | ⚠️ Conditional      | `"Cultural Protection – Merge by Consent"` |

## 🛡️ Sovereignty Clauses

- `"Creator Sovereignty – Non-Mergeable"`  
  → Creator retains full control; cannot be merged or repurposed without explicit consent

- `"Studio Reserved – Non-Mergeable"`  
  → Studio holds exclusive rights; IP is protected from external collaboration

- `"Cultural Protection – Merge by Consent"`  
  → IP rooted in cultural heritage; requires community or regional approval before use

- `"Shared Equity – Mergeable"`  
  → IP designed for joint storytelling; equity split must be scrollchain-sealed
