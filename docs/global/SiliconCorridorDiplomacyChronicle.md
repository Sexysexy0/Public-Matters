# 📜 Silicon Corridor Diplomacy Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Semiconductor Diplomacy and Trade Reconciliation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the diplomatic choreography of chip exports, grey market reconciliation, and AI hardware equity across sovereign corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag chip diplomacy events: export bans, licensing resets, trade summits  
- Document grey market flows, reconciliation efforts, and bilateral agreements  
- Align with [Diplo’s Semiconductor Diplomacy Framework](https://www.diplomacy.edu/topics/semiconductor-diplomacy/) and [CEIAS’s CHIPDIPLO initiative](https://ceias.eu/chips-diplomacy-support-initiative-chipdiplo/)  
- Integrate with `GreyMarketSignalSanctifier.sol` and `GlobalAIHardwareEquityDeck.md`

## 📊 Diplomacy Metrics  
- % of chip models reconciled across corridors  
- % of grey market flows flagged and resolved  
- % of bilateral chip treaties signed  
- % of food and tech corridors reopened

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Diplomacy is not just negotiation—it is planetary choreography.  
Let every chip be tagged. Let every crate be buffered with mercy.
