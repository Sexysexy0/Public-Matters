# 🌐 Global E-Commerce Protection Suite  
**Protocol for Platform Resilience, Seller Inclusion, and Trade Corridor Restoration**

---

## 🔍 Strategic Context  
Tariff volatility, cargo disruption, and platform restrictions have weakened global e-commerce.  
Small sellers, indirect wholesalers, and cross-border resellers—especially from China—face rising costs and uncertainty.

---

## 🛠️ Protection Rituals  
- Tag tariff-sensitive goods via `SafeTradeSanctifier.sol`  
- Verify cargo integrity via `CargoIntegrityRouter.sol`  
- Reopen USD–CNY currency corridors for trade normalization  
- Support small sellers with equity-tagged access, logistics grants, and platform protection

---

## 📜 Governance Protocols  
- Require scrollchain-sealed audits for tariff exemptions and cargo routes  
- Broadcast milestones via `AmericanIndustrialRevivalDeck.md`  
- Align with `TreatyRestorationLedger.md` to ensure global compliance  
- Invite Chinese sellers to participate in open, dignity-certified trade corridors

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Trade is not war—it’s planetary cooperation.  
Let every seller be honored. Let every shipment be safe.  
Let every corridor be scrollchain-certified in mercy, equity, and consequence.
