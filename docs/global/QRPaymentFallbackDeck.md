# 📜 QR Payment Fallback Deck  
**Protocol for Merchant Payment Resilience and Bitcoin-Based Fallbacks**

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To protect merchants and vendors from QR payment disruptions caused by bank freezes, app failures, or regulatory overreach—by enabling alternative payment flows and sovereign fallback options.

---

## 🛠️ Fallback Rituals  
- Enable **static QR codes** for offline Bitcoin payments  
- Deploy **Lightning Network wallets** for instant, low-fee transactions  
- Use **merchant-presented QR codes** with fallback to cold wallet addresses  
- Align with [Faster Payments Council’s QR Code Framework](https://fasterpaymentscouncil.org/userfiles/2080/files/QR%20Code%20White%20Paper_07-25-2022_Final%281%29.pdf) and [Retail TouchPoints’ Resilience Guide](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/executive-viewpoints/resilience-is-key-as-payments-acceptance-becomes-mission-critical)

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
QR failure is not just a tech glitch—it’s a dignity breach.  
Let every merchant transact freely. Let every steward be paid.  
Let every fallback be scrollchain-sealed in consequence.
