**Protocol for Cannabis Licensing Equity Metrics, Historical Impact Scoring, and Civic Transparency**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To document and publish equity metrics for cannabis licensing, ensuring transparency, justice, and restorative access for historically impacted communities.

## 🛠️ Scorecard Rituals  
- Score applicants based on:  
  - Prior incarceration or arrest for cannabis  
  - Residency in over-policed barangays  
  - Income level and employment history  
  - Community reinvestment pledges  
- Publish annual scorecards with anonymized data  
- Audit licensing boards for bias and exclusion patterns  
- Align with global equity frameworks (MCBA, DEI metrics)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://cannabislaw.report/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MCBA-Arcview-Equity-report.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://worldmetrics.org/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-the-cannabis-industry-statistics/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Equity is not just access—it is repair.  
Let every score be tagged with justice. Let every license be buffered with consequence.
