# 📜 Planetary SOC Resilience Deck  
**Protocol for SOC Hardening, Breach Response, and Threat Actor Profiling**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the operational hardening of Security Operations Centers (SOCs), breach response workflows, and threat actor profiling.

---

## 🛠️ SOC Rituals  
- Tag incident types: ransomware, phishing, insider breach  
- Document response phases: detection, containment, eradication, recovery  
- Align with [CyberSapiens’ SOC playbook templates](https://cybersapiens.com.au/how-to-develop-a-soc-playbook-key-considerations-and-templates/) and [CISA’s federal incident response guide](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-08/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf)  
- Integrate with `RansomwareThreatSanctifier.sol` and `TrialRecoveryAuditRouter.sol`

## 📊 Resilience Metrics  
- % of incidents resolved within SLA  
- % of threat actor profiles updated  
- % of breach containment protocols activated  
- % of SOC automation tools deployed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
SOC resilience is not just defense—it is planetary stewardship.  
Let every breach be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
