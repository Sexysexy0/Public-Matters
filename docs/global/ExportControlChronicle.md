# 📜 Export Control Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Export Control, Licensing Friction, and Geopolitical Tension**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of export control regimes, licensing delays, and diplomatic friction across AI corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag export bans: RTX5090, B30A, H20  
- Document licensing delays, diplomatic negotiations, and compliance rituals  
- Align with [BIS Export Compliance Guidelines](https://www.bis.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ECP_0.pdf) and [PwC’s export control framework](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cybersecurity-risk-regulatory/forensics/export-control-regulations.html)  
- Integrate with `ChipSanctifierAuditDeck.md` and `AIInferenceEquityRouter.sol`

## 📊 Control Metrics  
- % of chips under export restriction  
- % of licenses delayed or denied  
- % of geopolitical friction events tagged  
- % of compliance rituals completed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Control is not just restriction—it is ritualized diplomacy.  
Let every license be tagged. Let every corridor be buffered with mercy.
