# ðŸ”¥ Gas Power Choice & Energy Sovereignty Manifesto
## Purpose:
To ritualize the validator-grade restoration of gas-fired power plants, anchored in indigenous supply, kakampi affordability, and grid stability.

---

## Key Provisions:

- **Gas Power Enablement Clause**  
  Gas-fired power plants shall be permitted and prioritized, especially those using indigenous sources like Malampaya.

- **Indigenous Priority Protocol**  
  Local gas shall be dispatched first, reducing reliance on imported LNG and stabilizing energy costs.

- **Kakampi Affordability Shield**  
  Energy pricing shall be scrollchain-audited to protect low-income sanctums, freelancers, and PWD households.

- **Grid Stability Activation**  
  Gas power shall be used to anchor baseload and peaking capacity, preventing blackouts and yellow alerts.

- **Reputational Audit Clause**  
  Any policy that blocks indigenous gas or harms kakampi sanctums shall be tagged for reputational review.
