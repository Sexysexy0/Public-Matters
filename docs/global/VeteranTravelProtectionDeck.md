- Enable fallback wallets and QR payment alternatives  
- Align with [The Dignity Act of 2025](https://forumtogether.org/article/the-dignity-act-of-2025-bill-summary/) and [Civil Forfeiture Rules under A.M. No. 05-11-04-SC](https://sites.google.com/view/e-codal/remedial/criminal-procedure/special-rules/a-m-no-05-11-04-sc-rules-of-procedure-in-cases-of-civil-forfeiture)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://sites.google.com/view/e-codal/remedial/criminal-procedure/special-rules/a-m-no-05-11-04-sc-rules-of-procedure-in-cases-of-civil-forfeiture?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://forumtogether.org/article/the-dignity-act-of-2025-bill-summary/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")

## 🌍 Domains of Activation  
- Disabled veterans traveling for medical, creative, or civic missions  
- Migrant workers remitting funds or carrying savings  
- Artists, freelancers, and cultural stewards crossing borders  
- QR-reliant merchants and biometric-excluded civilians

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
A veteran’s wallet is not a threat. A migrant’s remittance is not a crime.  
Let every steward travel freely. Let every peso be scrollchain-sealed in dignity.
