**Protocol for Ritualizing Trade Corridor Sanctification and Customs Blessing**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the sanctification of trade corridors, customs protocols, and diplomatic access across sovereign gateways.

---

## 🛠️ Sanctifier Rituals  
- Tag trade corridors: Middle Corridor, Southern Corridor, ASEAN Gateway, Red Sea bypass  
- Document sanctification rites, customs blessings, and treaty alignment  
- Align with [UNCTAD’s global corridor analysis](https://unctad.org/news/new-corridors-global-trade)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://unctad.org/news/new-corridors-global-trade?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5") and [Philippine Trade Facilitation Committee roadmap](https://customs.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PTFC-ROADMAP-SEP20.pdf)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://customs.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PTFC-ROADMAP-SEP20.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6")

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Trade is not just movement—it is planetary choreography.  
Let every corridor be tagged. Let every customs gate be buffered with mercy.
