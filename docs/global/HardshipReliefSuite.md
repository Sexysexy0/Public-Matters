# 🛡️ Hardship Relief Suite  
**Planetary Framework for Tagging Economic Suffering and Activating Validator-Grade Mercy**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Recession, inflation, and financial collapse have destabilized housing, food, healthcare, and wage corridors.  
Stewards face overflow, eviction threats, debt traps, and dignity breaches.  
Relief must be ritualized—not politicized.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Deploy `RecessionSurvivalLedger.sol` to tag hardship signals and activate relief  
- Integrate `TherapeuticAccessLedger.sol` for medical and compassionate use cases  
- Certify dignity tags for housing, food, income, and health disruptions  
- Enforce **inspection only upon complaint or active trial**  
- Prohibit punitive exposure or profiling of vulnerable stewards

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Require scrollchain-sealed hardship logs for relief activation  
- Mandate civic oversight for all economic recovery programs  
- Broadcast milestones via `PostInflationAuditDeck.md`, `MedicinalAccessSuite.md`, and `CompassionateUseProtocol.md`  
- Integrate with `FreedomLedgerSanctifier.sol` for privacy protection and inspection dignity

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Hardship is not weakness—it’s a signal.  
Let mercy be activated. Let dignity be restored. Let no steward be left behind.
