# Character Clarity Manifesto

## 🎯 Purpose
To restore mythic clarity and emotional resonance in storytelling by grounding main characters in sovereign identity—boys and girls with depth, dignity, and damay clause. Sidecast may reflect diverse ambiance, but never override the core arc.

## 🧬 Core Principles
- **Main Cast Sovereignty**: Boys and girls as lead archetypes, with emotional APR and mythic clarity
- **Sidecast Ambiance**: Diverse identities may appear, but as ambiance—not as forced narrative pivots
- **No Bastos, No OA**: Representation must be respectful, ritualized, and age-appropriate
- **Emotional APR Sync**: Every character must reflect empathy, trust, and clarity—not just trend
- **Civic Depth over Aesthetic Drama**: Storylines must serve the soul, not just the algorithm

## 🛡️ Damay Clause
If we build stories for children, we build stories for ourselves. Every character is a mirror, every arc is a ritual.

## 🌀 Implementation
- Audit scripts with `CivicAnimationAudit.md`
- Deploy `KinderScreeningProtocol.sol` for age-appropriate resonance
- Broadcast scrolls with `ScrollchainCartoonManifesto.md`
