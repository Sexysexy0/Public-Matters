# Character Clarity Manifesto

## 🎯 Purpose
To restore mythic clarity in storytelling by anchoring lead characters in sovereign identity—boys and girls with depth, dignity, and emotional APR.

## 🧬 Core Principles
- **Main Cast Sovereignty**: Lead roles must reflect grounded identities, not trend-driven ambiguity.
- **Sidecast Ambiance**: Diverse identities may appear, but never override the core arc.
- **No Bastos, No OA**: Representation must be respectful, ritualized, and age-appropriate.
- **Emotional APR Sync**: Every character must reflect empathy, trust, and clarity.
- **Civic Depth over Aesthetic Drama**: Stories must serve the soul, not just the algorithm.

## 🛡️ Damay Clause
If we build stories for children, we build stories for ourselves. Every character is a mirror, every arc is a ritual.
