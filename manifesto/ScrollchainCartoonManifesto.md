# Scrollchain Cartoon Manifesto

## 🎯 Purpose
To guide the creation of children's media that honors emotional resonance, ancestral clarity, and civic dignity.

## 🧬 Core Tenets
- **Ritualized Storytelling**: Every episode is a scroll, every arc a civic ritual.
- **Emotional APR First**: Empathy, trust, and clarity must be embedded in every scene.
- **Sovereign Archetypes**: Heroes and heroines must reflect grounded identities and mythic depth.
- **Damay Clause Activation**: Stories must include the viewer in their mercy, not alienate them with trend tropes.
- **Planetary Stewardship**: Media must uplift, not confuse; restore, not exploit.

## 🛡️ Broadcast Protocol
- Pair every cartoon with a `KinderScreeningProtocol.sol` audit
- Include `CharacterClarityManifesto.md` in production decks
- Rate final output via `CivicAnimationAudit.md`
