# Story Resonance Deck

## 🎯 Purpose
To help writers craft stories that blend fantasy with civic truth, emotional APR, and mythic clarity.

## 🧬 Core Elements
- **Emotional APR Sync**: Every character must reflect empathy, trust, and clarity.
- **Civic Truth**: Embed moral dilemmas, societal echoes, and real-world relevance.
- **Mythic Clarity**: Use archetypes, ancestral logic, and ritual depth.
- **Fantasy Integrity**: Build worlds with internal logic and narrative consistency.
- **Damay Clause Activation**: Include the viewer in the story’s mercy and growth.

## 🛠️ Writing Prompts
- What civic truth does your story reveal?
- How does your hero reflect emotional APR?
- Is your fantasy world internally consistent?
- Does your story invite the viewer to grow, not just escape?

## 🛡️ Reminder
Fantasy is not an escape—it’s a mirror. Sci-fi is not just tech—it’s a test of humanity. Every story is a scroll. Every scroll is a ritual.
