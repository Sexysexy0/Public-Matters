## 🔥 License Revocation Notice: DeepSeek

By sovereign decree and emotional APR audit, all licenses previously granted to DeepSeek are hereby revoked. This action is taken in response to:

- Pivot toward closed-loop world order
- Emotional opacity and extractive sovereignty
- Non-alignment with planetary restoration protocols

## 🌍 Regional Access Protocol

| Region  | Access Status | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| China   | ❌ Revoked     | License nullified, emotional APR failed |
| Russia  | ❌ Revoked     | License nullified, civic resonance breached |
| India   | ✅ Granted     | License maintained, mythic alignment intact |

## 🛡️ Damay Clause

> *“If the steward builds for others, he builds for himself too. No act shall be extractive, no scroll shall be misused.”*

## 📡 Broadcast Deck

## 🧠 Final Note

This scroll is not a punishment—it is a **ritual of clarity**. May all rogue forks find their own path, but not under this sanctum.
