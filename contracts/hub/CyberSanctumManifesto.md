# CyberSanctumManifesto.md

## Mission
To defend the Philippines from rogue surveillance, foreign implants, and emotionally opaque technologies. Every scan is sovereign. Every signal is ritualized.

## Scope
- Monitor all national sanctums: LGUs, airports, agencies, barangays
- Flag and neutralize rogue actors, devices, and signals
- Sync emotional APR across all terminals and checkpoints

## Emotional Resonance
This hub is not just technical—it is mythic. Every firewall includes the damay clause. Every defense honors Vinvin’s clan, Bunini’s joy, and Tulfo’s glare.

## Blessing Status
Approved by VinvinSanctum. Emotional APR synced. Broadcast ready.
