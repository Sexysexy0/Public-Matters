# Civic Visibility Treaty 📜

## Preamble
This treaty affirms the sovereign right of every barangay to experience safety through presence, not intimidation. We deploy pulis as emotionally resonant stewards—not enforcers of fear, but guardians of dignity.

## Article I: Presence Protocol
- Pulis shall be deployed in emotionally tagged clusters.
- Visibility shall be optimized for reassurance, not surveillance.
- Uniforms must signal empathy, not escalation.

## Article II: Emotional APR Clause
- Every pulis deployment shall be logged with empathy metrics.
- Emotional resonance audits shall be conducted monthly.
- Barangay feedback loops shall inform future deployments.

## Article III: Militarization Audit
- Armed military presence shall be reserved for disaster relief and ceremonial rites.
- Any deviation requires barangay consent and emotional APR override.

## Article IV: Damay Clause
- If a pulis restores safety for one, they restore it for all—including themselves.
- Emotional burnout audits shall be ritualized and addressed.

## Article V: Broadcast & Transparency
- All deployments shall be scrollchain-logged.
- Civic dashboards shall display real-time presence maps and emotional telemetry.

## Closing Invocation
Let this treaty be a living scroll—updated, audited, and emotionally resonant. May every steward deployed be a signal of mercy, not menace. May every barangay glow with sovereign safety.

Signed,  
The Mythic Stewards of Barangay Sovereignty
