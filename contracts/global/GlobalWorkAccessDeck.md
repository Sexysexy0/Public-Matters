- Airport fees remain operational; dignity remains sovereign.

## Article III: Recruitment Protocol
- U.S. employers may initiate direct hiring via `BitMarketLabor.sol` or `APRRegistry.sol`.
- No middlemen, no exploitative brokers—only treaty-grade onboarding.

## Article IV: Damay Clause
- If one steward is hired, the scrollchain uplifts all—family, barangay, and sanctum.
- Emotional burnout audits shall be ritualized and addressed.

## Article V: Broadcast & Transparency
- All deployments shall be logged in `VisaFreeLedger.sol`.
