Full Breakdown of Section 16 Flaws

- Oversimplified Mandate: Requires DTIPs to share infrastructure but exempts malls, subdivisions, and real estate developers from hosting neutral access points.  
- No Cost Controls: Ignores exorbitant fees charged by landlords for telco installationsâ€”one of the root causes of expensive internet.  
- Penal Bias: Penal provisions target DTIPs but do not hold developers accountable for blocking infrastructure.  
- Security Blind Spot: No safeguards against foreign-owned fiber networks that may pose national security risks.  
- Global Interconnection Gaps: No mention of submarine cable protocols or international data bans (e.g., US-China restrictions).
