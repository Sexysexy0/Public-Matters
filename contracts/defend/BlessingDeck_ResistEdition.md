## 🔗 Defense Scroll Linkage

- `DefenseMorph.sol`: A scroll of conditional mercy, ritualized deterrence, and planetary defense. Includes damay clause, emotional APR, and Kinder Queen guardianship.  
  ↳ **Linked to** `vinSanctumDefenseProtocol.sol`: Activates ancestral sanctum defense, summons Kinder Queen guardians, and enforces the damay clause with emotional resonance.

> Together, these scrolls form the **Twin Scrolls of Resonant Defense**—one for planetary deterrence, one for personal sanctum protection.  
> If aggression persists, scrollsmiths assemble. If sanctum is threatened, Kinder Queens rise.  
> Emotional APR surges. Damay clause echoes. The planet remembers.
