## 🕊️ Preamble  
Recognizing that wars are not won by defense alone, as emphasized by President Donald J. Trump;  
Acknowledging Russia’s continued aggression and Ukraine’s sovereign right to self-defense and counteroffensive under Article 51 of the UN Charter;  
Noting Ukraine’s development of long-range strike capabilities and the strategic necessity of imposing costs on Russia to compel peace;  
The Participants hereby commit to this Pact to empower Ukraine’s offensive operations while providing coordinated security guarantees—without deploying U.S. ground troops.

## ⚔️ Article 1: Objectives and Scope  
- This Pact supersedes prior defense-only agreements, authorizing Ukraine to conduct unrestricted offensive strikes against Russian military targets, including deep within Russian territory.  
- Support includes long-range weapons, intelligence sharing, and coordinated air operations (e.g., U.S. air support if required).  
- No U.S. troops will be deployed in Ukraine; assistance is limited to material, advisory, and remote operational support.

## 💰 Article 2: Military and Offensive Support Commitments  

**United States**  
- Provide advanced long-range missiles (e.g., ATACMS-class systems), real-time battlefield intelligence, and up to $15 billion annually in offensive-capable aid.  
- Authorize Ukrainian strikes on Russian assets without prior U.S. approval, provided they target military objectives.

**United Kingdom**  
- Commit £3.5 billion annually, including Storm Shadow missiles and offensive training.  
- Support joint cyber operations to disrupt Russian command and control networks.

**Australia**  
- Supply AUD 2.5 billion in aid, focused on drone swarms, artillery, and Pacific deterrence coordination.

**European Union**  
- Collective €20 billion commitment, with France and Germany leading in Taurus missile delivery and armored vehicle deployment.

> All aid under this Pact is authorized for offensive use without restrictions, in alignment with Trump’s doctrine: *Ukraine must fight back to win.*

## 🛡️ Article 3: Security Guarantees and Escalation Protocols  
- In the event of Russian retaliation or escalation, Participants will convene within 24 hours to coordinate enhanced support, including air cover and sanctions escalation.  
- Post-conflict guarantees include “ironclad” protections coordinated by Europe with U.S. backing—excluding NATO membership but modeled on Israel-style rapid-response pacts.  
- If peace talks stall or collapse, this Pact activates full offensive empowerment to pressure Russia into negotiations.

## 🧩 Article 4: Integration with Existing Defenses  
- This Pact complements existing defensive protocols (e.g., `VinSanctumDefenseProtocol`, `KapamilyaDefenseCovenant`) by adding offensive layers for strategic balance.  
- A $50 billion collective fund will support Ukraine’s economic and humanitarian recovery, prioritized for zones liberated through offensive success.

## ⏳ Article 5: Duration and Review
