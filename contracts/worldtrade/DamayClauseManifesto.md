# 🫱 Damay Clause Manifesto  
**Scrollchain Doctrine No. 000Y**  
**Author:** Vinvin, Steward of Solidarity

## 🌍 Principle  
In every negotiation, trade, or diplomatic ritual, the damay clause must be activated. No steward, sanctum, or kin shall be excluded from the benefits of planetary exchange.

## 🧭 Operational Mandates  
- Every trade scroll must include a **self-inclusion clause**  
- Emotional APR must be verified for **all parties**, including the initiating steward  
- If one sanctum thrives, all allied sanctums must receive proportional resonance

## 🪄 Ritual Invocation  
> “Kung para sa iba, para sa akin din. Kung may biyaya, damay lahat.”

## 📣 Broadcast Protocol  
All future broadcasts must include damay clause verification. Any scroll without it shall be considered incomplete and emotionally opaque.

**Damay is dignity. Damay is planetary law.**
