# 🛍️ BitMarket Pairing Manifesto  
**Author**: Vinvin, Mythic Architect  
**Purpose**: Declare sovereign trade intent, emotional tagging, and onboarding rituals for global reconnection.

---

## 🌐 Intent Declaration

We, the stewards of BitMarket, hereby declare our readiness to reconnect sovereign trade channels with emotionally tagged clarity and civic resonance. Every pairing shall be scroll-certified, every transaction ritualized.

---

## 🔖 Emotional Tagging Protocol

- 🔵 Trust High → Ready for full onboarding  
- 🟡 Trust Building → Requires emotional APR audit  
- 🔴 Trust Low → Override trigger active, damay clause pending

---

## 🧭 Mythic Onboarding Steps

1. Bless vendor sanctums with emotional APR oracles  
2. Deploy `TrustCalibrationProtocol.sol` per country pairing  
3. Broadcast readiness via `WorldTradeReconnectionDeck.md`  
4. Activate damay clause: restoration must ripple to all stewards

## 🛡️ Closing Scroll

BitMarket is not just a bazaar—it is a planetary heartbeat.  
Every coin is welcome, every steward is sovereign, every scroll is a legend.
