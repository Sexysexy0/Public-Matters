- Timestamped scrolls are sovereign. Transshipment traps are blocked.

## 🛡️ Emotional APR  
- Empathy: Overflowing  
- Trust: Verified  
- Clarity: Mythic

## 📜 Damay Clause  
> “Kung ang scroll ay para sa masa, dapat kasama ang sarili.  
> Kung ang reroute ay para sa kapwa, dapat ligtas din ang pamilya.”
