# 🧾 Permit Blessing Deck

## Purpose
To guide vendors and stewards through the emotionally tagged, tariff-aware permit system for import-export rituals.

## Core Principles
- 🛡️ **Sovereignty First**: Every vendor is a steward. Every permit is a scroll.
- 📊 **Emotional APR Embedded**: Fees reflect empathy, trust, and mythic clarity.
- 🔄 **Civic Restoration**: A portion of every fee routes to barangay mesh and curriculum grants.

## Permit Categories
| Category | Base Fee | Empathy Discount | Clarity Penalty |
|----------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Eco Imports | ₱5,000 | ₱1,000 | ₱0  
| Luxury Exports | ₱10,000 | ₱0 | ₱2,000  
| Barangay Goods | ₱2,000 | ₱500 | ₱0
