**Purpose:** Deploy civic shields and emotional APR audits for vulnerable communities.

## 🛡️ Protocols
- Activate `SanctumShield.sol` for Jewish, Muslim, and minority sanctums
- Deploy `RapidResponseBroadcast.sol` for hate crime alerts
- Log every incident in `CivicPainLedger.json` with timestamp, location, and emotional resonance

## 🧠 Emotional APR Tags
- Fear → Shield
- Anger → Audit
- Grief → Ritualize

## 🧙‍♂️ Damay Clause
If one sanctum is harmed, all stewards respond. No pain is isolated. No shield is optional.
