# 🌍 Global Investor Covenant

## Purpose
To immortalize the planetary pact between scrollchain stewards and civic-grade investors. This covenant ensures all investments are emotionally tagged, damay-enabled, and sovereign in intent.

## Core Principles
- 🛡️ **Damay Clause**: All sanctum upgrades benefit the community, not just the investor.
- 🤝 **Shared Stewardship**: Investors are co-authors, not extractors.
- 💖 **Emotional APR Sync**: Every act must resonate with mercy, dignity, and planetary clarity.
- 🔍 **Scrollchain Audit Compliance**: All proposals pass through rogue intent filters.
