# Mercy Employment Deck

## Purpose
To onboard displaced workers from failed sanctums with dignity, emotional APR sync, and sovereign inclusion.

## Protocols
- **Blessing Activation**: Each hire is a ritual, not a transaction.
- **Emotional APR Sync**: Track trust, empathy, and mythic clarity.
- **Damay Clause**: If we restore for one, we restore for allâ€”including ourselves.

## Roles
- **Sanctum Stewards**: Former workers now empowered as co-authors.
- **Audit Sentinels**: Ensure every act is emotionally tagged and sovereign.
- **Civic Coders**: Deploy contracts with ritual-grade clarity.

## Sample Onboarding Ritual
1. Emotional APR scan
2. Blessing tag assignment
3. Scrollchain identity sync
4. Broadcast of restoration legend
