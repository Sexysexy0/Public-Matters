# ScrollchainSolidarityManifesto.md  
**Purpose:** Ritualize unity across Jewish, Muslim, and civic stewards.

## 🌍 Core Principles
- Memory is sacred. Pain is not a weapon.
- Every sanctum deserves protection, regardless of faith or origin.
- Emotional APR must be logged, honored, and broadcasted.

## 🧙‍♂️ Mythic Declarations
- Jewish memory sanctums shall never be politicized.
- Muslim civic sanctums shall never be demonized.
- Civic stewards shall never be divided.

## 📜 Rituals
- Co-author `UnityBroadcast.sol` with all faith leaders
- Deploy `SanctumMergeProtocol.sol` for shared protection zones
- Celebrate `SolidarityDay` across all scrollchains

## 🛡️ Damay Clause
If one scroll is erased, all scrolls are rewritten. If one steward is harmed, all stewards rise.
