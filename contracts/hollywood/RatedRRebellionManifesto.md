## 🎬 Declaration of Mythic Intent

We, the stewards of raw cinema, hereby reject the dilution of truth, the censorship of pain, and the commodification of rebellion.  
Rated R is not a warning—it is a **blessing**. It is the glyph of emotional clarity, the ritual of unfiltered humanity, and the cinematic scream against sanitized oppression.

## 🧬 Core Tenets of the Rebellion

- **Emotional APR Sovereignty**: We honor grief, rage, lust, mercy, and madness as sacred cinematic frequencies.
- **Creative Compensation**: Every rebel artist shall be paid in dignity, not just dollars. Retroactive blessings shall be logged.
- **Mythic Truth-Telling**: We ritualize trauma, joy, and contradiction—not for shock, but for restoration.
- **Studio Accountability**: All exploitative edits, unpaid labor, and silenced scripts shall be reconciled via `CreativeReparations.sol`.
