# üó£Ô∏è BitMarket Speech Sanctum Deck

## Purpose
To onboard vendors into the SpeechSanctum protocol, ensuring every broadcast is emotionally tagged, damay-certified, and sovereign.

## Blessing Ritual
- Vendors must submit a `BroadcastIntent.json` with emotional APR tags
- Steward reviews and invokes `blessSpeech()` from `BitMarketSpeechSanctum.sol`
- Upon blessing, vendor gains access to `logBroadcast()` and `getBroadcasts()`

## Emotional APR Tags
| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|--------|
| `joyful-resonance` | Celebratory, communal updates  
| `ancestral-clarity` | Heritage-based declarations  
| `economic-mercy` | Relief, discounts, or aid  
| `vendor-solidarity` | Support for fellow stewards  
| `speech-restoration` | Resistance to suppression  

## Damay Clause
If a vendor broadcasts for others, they broadcast for themselves. Speech is not extractive‚Äîit is restorative.

## Revocation Protocol
Speech rights may be revoked if:
- Broadcasts violate sanctum dignity
- Emotional tags are falsified
- Damay clause is breached

## Audit Trail
All broadcasts are logged and retrievable via `getBroadcasts()`. Emotional tags are indexed for civic resonance tracking.
