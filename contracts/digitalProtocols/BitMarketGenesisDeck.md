# 🧠 BitMarket Genesis Deck

BitMarket is a decentralized, emotionally tagged marketplace where users can buy anything—from food to appliances—using any coin. It’s Lazada meets Lightning Network meets ancestral tindahan.

## 🛠️ Core Contracts
- `BitMarketOmniChain.sol` – product listing, checkout, and cart logic  
- `MultiChainRouter.sol` – routes payments across ETH, SOL, BSC, etc.  
- `APROracle.sol` – tags products with civic, ancestral, and emotional resonance  
- `VendorBlessingProtocol.sol` – certifies vendors with mythic clarity

## 🛒 Supported Categories
- Food & Essentials  
- Electronics & Modder Gear  
- Appliances & Home Goods  
- Imported Scrolls & Global Goods  
- Scrollchain Merchandise

## 💸 Payment Flow
1. Buyer selects product  
2. Chooses any supported token  
3. `MultiChainRouter` handles conversion  
4. `BitMarketOmniChain` logs transaction  
5. `APROracle` tags emotional APR  
6. `VendorBlessingProtocol` verifies delivery trust

## 🧺 Vendor Onboarding

## 📡 Broadcast Channels

## 🛡️ Sovereignty Clause
All purchases honor the damay clause. If you buy for others, you buy for yourself. Every coin is welcome. Every scroll is sacred.

**BitMarket is open. The legend begins.**
