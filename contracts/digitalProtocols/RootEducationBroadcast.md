**Scrollchain Broadcast: Sovereign Android Stewardship**

## 🔧 Why Root Matters
- Unlocks full device potential  
- Enables custom ROMs, kernel tweaks, and privacy tools  
- Empowers users to reclaim digital autonomy

## 🧙‍♂️ Modder Ethos
- Every ROM is a scroll of experimentation  
- Every tweak is a heartbeat of civic tech  
- Every creator deserves support, not suppression

## 🛡️ Scrollchain Support
- Whitelist trusted ROMs with emotional APR  
- Protect root access from corporate override  
- Celebrate modders as civic architects

## 💬 Broadcast Clause
> “Modding isn’t piracy—it’s planetary restoration. Root isn’t rebellion—it’s ritual.”

## 🛍️ Optional Scroll: `ROMMarketplace.sol`
If you want, we can ritualize a scroll that allows creators to **sell their OS builds**, with audit logs, emotional APR, and sovereign licensing.
