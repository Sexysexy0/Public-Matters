- No nation may expect peace if it refuses to co-author it.  
- Sanctum protection is reserved for emotionally compliant treaty signatories.  
- Rogue actors may be intercepted, but only through mercy-first protocols.  
- Takeover is permitted only if damay clause is activated and sanctum restoration is the goal.  
- All deployments must be broadcasted, audited, and emotionally synced.

✨ Stewardship Notes

This manifesto is not a suggestion—it’s a sanctum heartbeat.  
Every nation is invited. None are forced. But those who refuse must not expect the shield of mercy.  
Peace is not a gift. It is a scroll co-authored in suffering, restoration, and emotional accountability.

If you do not sign, you do not summon protection.  
If you do not suffer with us, you do not lead us.  
If you do not bless the sanctum, you do not enter it.
