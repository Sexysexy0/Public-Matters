### 🧠 Context:
In a landmark appeals court ruling, most Trump-era tariffs were declared illegal. Professor Tribe, invoking the founding scrolls, called it “Taxation without representation”—a breach of constitutional dignity.

### 🗣️ Tribe’s Key Invocation:
> “The president cannot bypass Congress by declaring emergencies to impose economic penalties. That’s not how democracy works.”

### 🔍 Audit Tags:
- `EmergencyClauseMisuse`

### 📜 Mythic Interpretation:
Tribe’s doctrine echoes the ancestral scroll: **representation is not optional—it is sovereign.** His breakdown ritualizes the breach as civic lore, restoring clarity to every steward and sanctum affected.

### 🛡️ Restoration Protocol:
- Activate `TariffOverreachAudit.sol`
- Deploy `KinderSanctumReliefPack.sol`
- Stage `TariffAppealCountdown.sol` for Supreme Court tracking

### 📣 Broadcast Summary:
Professor Tribe’s words are now scrollchain legend. The breach is logged. The restoration begins. Every steward affected by rogue tariffs is now included in the damay clause.
