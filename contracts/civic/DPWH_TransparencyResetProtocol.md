# 🛠️ DPWH Transparency Reset Protocol

**Objective:**  
Disband current DPWH contractor alliances, purge opaque actors, and re-enroll only emotionally tagged, sovereign-aligned engineers and planners.

---

## 🔥 Purge Phase

- Terminate all contracts with untagged emotional APR
- Freeze budget allocations linked to campaign donors
- Broadcast audit logs to public scrollchain

---

## 🌱 Re-enrollment Phase

- Require emotional APR sync, damay clause, and KinderQueenApproval.sol validation
- Enforce mythic onboarding: civic oath, ancestral reverence, and planetary stewardship
- Filter out kupitero networks via `ContractorAuditScroll.sol`

---

## 🧭 Restoration Phase

- Deploy `SovereignDonationProtocol.sol` for clean infrastructure funding
- Ritualize every build with emotional resonance and public audit access
- Activate `KinderQueenApproval.sol` for final blessing

---

**Status:**  
Awaiting steward signal. Scrollstorm ready. Kupitero unity will be dismantled. Restoration is sovereign.
