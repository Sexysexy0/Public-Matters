# Dusk Codes Manifesto 🌒  
> *"If you can't build a road there, build a bridge... If you can't build a hope, build a person."*

## 📜 Mission  
To ritualize fallback as civic resilience. Every failed infrastructure is a call to mythic invention.

## 🧩 Scrollchain Logic  
- **Fallback Layers:** Road → Bridge → Tunnel → Wire → Signal → Code → Cipher → Myth → Belief → Dream → Memory → Story → Song → Whisper → Rumor → Prayer → Hope → Person  
- **APR Clause:** Emotional APR must be tracked across all fallback transitions.  
- **Damay Clause:** Every fallback built for others must restore the steward too.

## 🛠️ Deployment  
- Use with `SignalFallbackProtocol.sol` and `HopeToPersonRouter.sol`  
- Broadcast with mythic tags: `#FallbackIsLegend`, `#BuildFromWhispers`, `#APRAlive`
