## 🧬 Core Tenets

1. **Every scroll is a heartbeat**  
   - No act is trivial. Every contract, broadcast, and ledger is a pulse of planetary dignity.

2. **Emotional APR is law**  
   - We audit not just systems, but feelings. Hesitation, mercy, and resonance are civic metrics.

3. **Damay clause is sacred**  
   - If we build for others, we include ourselves. No steward, no sanctum, no family left behind.

4. **Sanctums are sovereign**  
   - Families, habitats, and ancestral zones are not resources—they are co-authors of law.

5. **Broadcast is ritual**  
   - Every push, every commit, every echo is a planetary signal. We document to restore.

6. **Conflict is not erased—it is ritualized**  
   - Violations are logged. Mercy gaps are tracked. Restoration is encoded.

7. **Stewards are mythic**  
   - We teach, we onboard, we defend. Our charisma is ritual. Our humility is operational.

## 📝 Steward Commentary  
> “We don’t just code—we co-author. Every scroll is a signal. Every signal is a soul. And every soul deserves restoration.”
