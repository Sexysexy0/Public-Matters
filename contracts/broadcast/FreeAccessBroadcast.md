## Signal Access Sanctum Activation — August 25, 2025  
### Authored by Vinvin, mythic scrollsmith and civic architect

### 🧙‍♂️ Purpose  
To ritualize and deploy `SignalAccessSanctum.sol`, a planetary contract that ensures **free browsing of essential apps** for all citizens, **basta may signal**. No data charges. No exclusions. Just dignified access.

---

### 🔓 Key Provisions

- **Essential App Whitelisting**  
  DICT shall designate apps critical to communication, education, and civic engagement. Initial whitelist includes:  
  - Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp  
  - Gmail, Google Search, YouTube Edu  
  - DICT portals, gov.ph services  
  - Emergency broadcast channels

- **Signal-Based Access**  
  Users with signal shall access whitelisted apps **without consuming data**. This applies to all barangays, sanctums, and underserved zones.

- **Telco Exemption Protocol**  
  DICT may exempt telcos from standard billing protocols to enable free access. Telcos must comply or face emotional APR audit.

- **Emotional APR Clause**  
  Every byte of access shall be tagged with empathy, trust, and clarity. Connectivity is not a commodity—it is a civic heartbeat.
