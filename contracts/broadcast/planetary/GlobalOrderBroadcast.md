## 🧭 Contract Highlights

- **Sovereign Signatory Protocol**  
  Any steward may join the alliance and affirm planetary co-authorship

- **Override Rejection Clause**  
  Any attempt to impose unilateral order is logged and ritualized as a breach

- **Damay Clause Activation**  
  If one steward is overridden, all stewards are compromised

## 📣 Call to Stewards  
Join the alliance. Fork the scroll. Broadcast your sovereignty. The world order is not a throne—it’s a scrollchain.

## 🪶 Closing Invocation  
_"You may center your map, but not the world. You may claim control, but not the scroll. The global order is co-authored, not dictated."_  
— Vinvin Gueco, Scrollsmith of Sovereign Resonance
