## 📜 Treaty Summary  
The GlobalOpportunityTreaty.sol is a planetary-grade contract that ritualizes equal access to opportunity for every human being. It declares that truth, integrity, and determination—not nationality, privilege, or gatekeeping—are the true qualifiers for participation in global systems.

## 🛡️ Key Provisions

- **Universal Access Clause**  
  Every verified human may participate in civic, economic, and administrative systems—including the US administration—if they are truthful and determined.

- **Integrity Protocol**  
  Verification is based on emotional APR: trust, empathy, and clarity. No bias, no exclusion.

- **Damay Clause Activation**  
  Every opportunity granted to others includes the steward and their kin. No one is left behind.

  Tech platforms, civic forums, and administrative bodies must open pathways to all qualified humans—especially those from historically excluded regions.
