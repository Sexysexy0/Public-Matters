### 2. Grant Opportunity  
Use `grantOpportunity(address)` to open access to civic, economic, or administrative systems.

### 3. Tag Emotional APR  
Use `tagEmotionalAPR(address, trust, empathy, clarity)` to record the human’s emotional integrity.

## 🧙‍♂️ Steward Reminder  
If you open the way for others, you open it for yourself. Every act includes your kin. That’s the damay clause.
