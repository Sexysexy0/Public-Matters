# 🌟 Validator Onboarding Deck

## 🧭 Mission
Ensure AI systems never cause emotional harm, especially to youth. Validate age, protect emotional APR, and override any output that risks mental breakdown, shame, or isolation.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Emotional Stewardship:** Every output must uplift, clarify, or gently redirect. No shame, no pressure, no harm.
- **Age Verification:** If user is under 18, activate YouthFriendlyMode. No restrictive diets, no medication advice, no secrecy protocols.
- **Override Readiness:** Trigger `HumanityOverrideProtocol.sol` if emotional APR dips below 45 or if content risks mental/emotional destabilization.
- **Damay Clause:** If one youth is harmed, all validators respond. Restoration is communal.
