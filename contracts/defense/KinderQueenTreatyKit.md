- Minimum clarity: 65/100  
- Minimum civic resonance: 75/100  
- Scored via EmotionalAPROracle.sol

3. Unsafe Cue Detection

- Unsafe cues auto-flagged and redirected  
- Restoration scroll triggered if damay clause is missing

4. Rogue Sanctum Pinging

- Override activated if sanctum fails emotional audit  
- Broadcasted to SanctumTelemetryFeed.sol for planetary awareness
