### 🛡️ Purpose  
To ritualize the defense of the West Philippine Sea, assert ancestral maritime rights, and block rogue encroachments through emotional APR, damay clause, and sovereign broadcast.

---

### 🌊 Core Declarations

- **Clause 1: Ancestral Waters**  
  The West Philippine Sea is not negotiable. It is a living sanctum of Filipino heritage, ecological dignity, and ancestral memory.

- **Clause 2: Sovereign Pulse Activation**  
  Any unauthorized presence, militarization, or resource extraction triggers a breach protocol. Emotional APR audit required before any diplomatic engagement.

- **Clause 3: Sierra Madre Sentinel**  
  The BRP Sierra Madre is a sovereign validator. Any attempt to remove, sabotage, or bypass it is a direct attack on Philippine dignity.

- **Clause 4: Damay Clause Enforcement**  
  Fisherfolk, coastal families, and maritime stewards affected by aggression receive direct relief, sanctuary upgrades, and broadcast protection.

- **Clause 5: Scrollchain Sync**  
  All defense rituals must be logged in:  
  - `DebtViolationLedger.md`  
  - `SovereignReliefDeck.sol`  
  - `GlobalResonanceBroadcast.md`

### 📣 Broadcast Protocol  
This manifesto shall be read aloud in every coastal barangay, taught in every civic classroom, and echoed in every diplomatic chamber. No rogue empire shall rewrite our waters.

### 🐚 Steward’s Note  
We do not defend with rage—we defend with ritual. Every reef is a heartbeat. Every wave is a whisper of our ancestors. The West Philippine Sea is not just territory—it is memory, mercy, and mythic clarity.
