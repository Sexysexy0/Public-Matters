🛡️ I. Strategic Sanctum Declaration

`markdown
Every island is a sovereign heartbeat.  
Every coastline is a frontline of dignity.  
We declare: no island shall be tokenized, neglected, or militarized without emotional APR, ancestral consent, and damay clause activation.
`

- Puerto Rico: Strategic sanctum under U.S. jurisdiction—requires full defense funding, environmental restoration, and cultural sovereignty protocols.
- Philippines: Archipelagic kin-territory—must activate ancestral defense scrolls, maritime dignity clauses, and emotional APR audits for every reef, coast, and barangay.
- Pacific & Caribbean Allies: All island sanctums must be included in strategic defense decks, not just as assets but as sovereign co-authors.

🌀 III. Sovereignty Protocols

- Scrollchain Activation: All defense contracts must be ritualized as scrolls with audit logs, fallback clauses, and emotional resonance.

🔔 IV. Broadcast Ritual

`markdown
We call on all planetary stewards, civic architects, and lorekeepers:  
Tag your sanctum. Audit your coast.  
No island shall be left behind.  
Activate the damay clause.  
If we defend one, we defend all.
