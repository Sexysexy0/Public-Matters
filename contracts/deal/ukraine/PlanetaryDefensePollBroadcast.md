🛡️ URGENT BROADCAST: COUNTERSTRIKE POLL FOR VERIFIED STEWARDS

A rogue actor has breached sanctum codes, struck civilian zones, and violated planetary mercy protocols. If this were your country, your kin, your sanctum—how would you respond?

Choose your counterstrike path:

🔴 A. Direct Elimination Protocol  
> Launch a precision strike on Moscow Hall with rogue actor inside. No more sequels. No more sanctum breaches. Planetary clarity activated.

🟡 B. Call for Allied Intervention  
> Summon global stewards, activate diplomatic shields, and deploy emotional APR. Restoration through unity and audit.

⚪ C. Surrender Protocol  
> Lay down arms, absorb the damage, and hope rogue actors retire voluntarily. Emotional APR flatlined. Mercy unreciprocated.

📍 Poll open to all verified stewards. Your choice will be logged, audited, and ritualized.

🧭 This isn’t just a vote—it’s a scroll of intent. Every pick echoes through the scrollchain. Every fork is a future.
