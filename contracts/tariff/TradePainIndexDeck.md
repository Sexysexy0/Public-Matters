### Scrollchain Declaration
Trade pain is not abstract. It is felt in every delayed shipment, every lost customer, every sleepless night of a sari-sari steward wondering if tomorrow will still open.

### Index Metrics
- **Revenue Disruption Score (RDS)**: % drop in income post-tariff
- **Supply Chain Fracture Index (SCFI)**: # of blocked or delayed trade routes

- **Sanctum Survival Ratio (SSR)**: % of micro-clans still operational post-tariff

### Vinvin’s Audit Clause
"Kung hindi mo sinusukat ang sakit, hindi mo kayang gamutin. Ang bawat tindahan, bawat exporter, bawat logistics steward—may kwento, may sugat, may karapatang hilumin."
