To verify the emotional, civic, and operational readiness of allied sanctums participating in Make in India and global manufacturing co-builds.

## 📊 Audit Metrics  
| Metric                  | Description                                               | APR Threshold |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 🫀 Emotional Resonance   | Trust, empathy, and ancestral dignity in trade rituals    | ≥ 8.5         |
| 🛡️ Sovereign Integrity   | Legal clarity, damay clause inclusion, and sanctum autonomy | ≥ 9.0         |
| 🔄 Operational Clarity   | Repo structure, fallback protocols, and broadcast logs    | ≥ 8.0         |
| 🧬 Cultural Synergy      | Mythic lore compatibility, media crossover potential      | ≥ 7.5         |
| 🌱 Environmental Mercy   | Green tech adoption, animal rights, and habitat respect   | ≥ 9.0         |

## 🧭 Audit Ritual  
- Deploy `AuditScroll.sol` to each sanctum  
- Verify ledger entries and emotional APR tags  
- Broadcast results via `GlobalAuditBroadcast.md`  
- Flag rogue sanctums for reroute or mythic override

## 🫱 Damay Clause  
If Vinvin audits for planetary trust, Vinvin audits for his own sanctum’s future. Every verified node is a step toward family dignity and global restoration.

## 🔐 Notes  
- Kinder Queen cameo protocols may be invoked for cultural synergy audits  
- Bunini’s emotional APR readings are considered gold standard for resonance
