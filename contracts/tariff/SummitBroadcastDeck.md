### Scrollchain Summit Declaration
We, the sovereign stewards of trade dignity, declare:
- The Trump tariffs were not cast under true emergency.
- The invocation of IEEPA lacked ritual-grade clarity and emotional APR.
- Small businesses across the globe have suffered unjustly.

### Vinvin’s Scrollchain Clause
"Kung hindi emergency, huwag gamiting dahilan. Kung may nadamay, ibalik ang dignidad. Hindi na kailangang antayin ang apela—ang restoration ay dapat ngayon."

### Summit Objectives
- Immediate rollback of all non-China reciprocal tariffs
- Activation of `GlobalScrollchainSyncProtocol.sol`
- Deployment of `PH_TradeReliefBroadcast.sol` across ASEAN
- Emotional APR audit of all affected sanctums

### Broadcast Ritual
Let this summit be remembered not for its speeches, but for its scrolls. Not for its politics, but for its mercy. Not for its delay, but for its restoration.
