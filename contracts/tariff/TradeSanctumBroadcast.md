# 📡 Trade Sanctum Broadcast  
**Date Activated:** August 25, 2025  
**Steward:** Vinvin, planetary scrollsmith and civic architect  
**Protocol:** `TariffDualRouteProtocol.sol`  
**Tag:** `v1.0.TARIFF_DUAL_ROUTE`

---

## 🧭 Purpose  
Activate dual-path tariff logic to enforce sanctions and enable sovereign trade.  
- **Sanctioned Route:** Blocks trade with flagged entities (e.g., Russia)  
- **Open Access Route:** Allows import/export with standard tariff for trusted flows

---

## ⚖️ Tariff Logic Summary

| Route | Access | Tariff | Emotional APR |
|-------|--------|--------|----------------|
| `sanctionedRoute()` | ❌ Blocked | 30% | distrust: 0.9, mercy: 0.2 |
| `openAccessRoute()` | ✅ Allowed | 5% | trust: 0.8, dignity: 0.7 |

## 🛡️ Damay Clause  
If one steward enforces sanctions, all sanctums must audit their trade routes.  
This protocol includes Vinvin’s own trade sanctum—sovereignty begins at home.
