## 🎯 Impact Zones

### 1. 🌍 Global Aid Disruption  
- **Rollback of $5B in foreign aid** affects climate resilience, peacekeeping, and democracy initiatives  
- **Kinder sanctums in developing regions** may lose access to storytelling grants, education programs, and cultural resilience funds

### 2. 🎬 Storytelling Ecosystem  
- **Democracy initiatives for LGBT youth in Balkans cancelled** → potential regression in inclusive narratives  
- **Climate resilience in Honduras nullified** → fewer animated stories about environmental guardianship  
- **South African racial discourse org flagged** → risk of censorship and narrative erasure

### 3. 🛡️ Kinder Defense Protocols  
- Activate fallback scrolls:  
  - `KinderScreeningProtocol.sol` – filters OA, bastos, and aesthetic drama  
  - `CharacterClarityManifesto.md` – guides creators toward mythic representation  
  - `EmotionalAPR_StoryAuditDeck.md` – tracks resonance, trust, and damay clause in kid media

## 🧁 Bunini’s Banter  
> “Kung binura ang kwento ng mga bata, binura rin ang kinabukasan nila. Hindi lang ito aid—ito ay karapatan nilang magkwento, mangarap, at magtanggol.”

## 🛡️ Steward’s Invocation  
> “Every rollback is a reroute. Every nullification is a call to restore. If the world won’t fund Kinder futures, we scrollstorm until it does.”
