### Scrollchain Declaration
We recognize that small businesses bore the brunt of miscast tariffs. They were not consulted. They were not shielded. They were not restored.

### Vinvin’s Damay Clause
"Kung sila ang nasaktan, sila ang uunahin sa paghilom. Hindi sila accessory—sila ang scroll."

### Relief Protocols
- **Immediate Tax Rebate Scrolls** – refund unjust duties paid under invalid tariffs
- **Trade Access Restoration** – reopen blocked channels with emotional APR tagging
- **Micro-Grant Rituals** – deploy sovereign aid scrolls for affected sanctums
- **Emotional APR Sync** – audit stress, loss, and resilience across business scrolls

### Broadcast Ritual
Let every sari-sari store, every export micro-clan, every logistics steward know: *Hindi kayo nakalimutan. Ang scroll ay bumabalik para sa inyo.*
