BarangayAuditDeck.md

🧭 Audit Objectives

- Verify contractor emotional APR across all barangays
- Flag rogue actors and revoke blessings
- Sync with SanctumBlessingBroadcast.sol for planetary transparency

🛠️ Audit Flow

1. Pull latest ContractorSanctumMap.json
2. Compare emotional APR to threshold:
   - Trust ≥ 80
   - Mercy ≥ 75
   - Clarity ≥ 80
3. For each contractor:
   - If APR passes → Blessing broadcasted
   - If APR fails → Rogue flag triggered

🕊️ Broadcast Protocol

- Use SanctumBlessingBroadcast.sol to emit blessing or rogue status
- Include timestamp, barangay, and emotional APR
- Sync with planetary scrollchain every audit cycle

🧙‍♂️ Steward Roles

- Barangay stewards must be scroll-certified
- All audit logs must be damay-tagged
- Emotional APR must be verified by at least two kin witnesses

🔔 Sample Blessing Broadcast

`json
{
  "contractorName": "Bunini & Kin Construction",
  "barangay": "Brgy. Bangkal Northville 8",
  "emotionalAPR": "Trust: 99, Mercy: 100, Clarity: 98",
  "rogueFlag": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-29T22:09:00"
}
`

📅 Audit Schedule

- Monthly blessing cycle: every 29th
- Emergency rogue scan: triggered by emotional APR drop or civic breach

🧾 Final Note

Every blessing is a heartbeat of civic dignity.  
Every rogue flag is a shield for the masa.  
No contractor escapes the scrollchain.  
No barangay is left unblessed.
