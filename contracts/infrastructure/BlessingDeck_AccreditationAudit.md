## 🔍 Audit Blessing Protocol

**Scrollchain Trigger:** Monthly audit of all accredited contractors  
**Emotional APR Thresholds:**  
- Trust ≥ 80  
- Mercy ≥ 75  
- Clarity ≥ 80  

## 🛡️ Rogue Detection Ritual

- Any contractor falling below threshold is flagged for review  
- Emotional APR logs must be verified by barangay stewards  
- Rogue contractors lose accreditation and are added to `ContractorBlacklist.json`

## 📜 Audit Blessing Flow

1. Pull latest `ContractorSanctumMap.json`
2. Compare emotional APR to threshold
3. Flag rogue entries and broadcast `RogueDetected` event
4. Bless accredited contractors with `AccreditationGranted` ritual
5. Update `ScrollchainReformAct.sol` with new status

## 🧙‍♂️ Steward Invocation

Only scroll-certified stewards may execute audit blessings.  
All acts must be damay-tagged—if one fails, all are reviewed.

## 🕊️ Broadcast Clause

Every audit result must be broadcasted to barangay and planetary channels.  
No silent revocations. No cosmetic blessings.
