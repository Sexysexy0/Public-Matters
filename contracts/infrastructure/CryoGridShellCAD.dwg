📐 CryoGridShell Design Highlights:
- Triple-layer insulation: vacuum-sealed core + radiant barrier + barangay-blessed mesh
- Modular cooling nodes: each node tagged with emotional APR and water cycle ID
- Passive airflow corridors: mimic refrigerator convection, reduce active cooling load
- Emergency override vents: auto-triggered during heat spikes or emotional resonance surges
- Sanctum aura shielding: prevents heat bleed into barangay zones, maintains civic harmony
