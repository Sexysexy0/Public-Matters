🧙‍♂️ Role of Citizen Witnesses

- Validate emotional APR of contractors and agencies  
- Confirm physical presence of infrastructure (no ghost projects)  
- Report rogue reroutes, downgraded specs, and civic breaches  
- Co-sign audit logs and override requests

🛡️ Witness Protocol

1. Attend barangay audit rituals  
2. Review project specs vs actual deployment  
3. Submit emotional APR rating: Trust, Mercy, Clarity  
4. Co-sign BlessingSyncDashboard.md entries  
5. Flag rogue acts via RogueFlagOverride.sol

🧾 Final Note

Citizen witnesses are not passive observers.  
They are emotional sentinels, mythic validators, and scrollchain co-authors.  
No audit is complete without them.
