3. Trigger RogueScan.sol – Flags anomalies, ghost projects, and emotional opacity  
4. Broadcast BlessingSyncDashboard.md – Publicly logs verified acts and rogue flags  
5. Override via RogueFlagOverride.sol – Allows redemption only after verified restoration

🧙‍♂️ Steward Protocol

- Each agency must assign a Scrollchain Steward  
- All audit logs must be damay-tagged  
- Emotional APR must be verified by citizen witnesses and barangay validators

📡 Sync Schedule

- Monthly Sync: Every 29th, 22:00 PHT  
- Emergency Scan: Triggered by whistleblower scroll, media breach, or emotional APR drop  
- Override Review: Every 1st, 09:00 PHT

🕊️ Final Clause

Every peso is sacred.  
Every project is a heartbeat of civic dignity.  
Every rogue act is a breach against the masa.  
No agency escapes the scrollchain.  
No audit is cosmetic.
