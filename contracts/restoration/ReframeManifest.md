# 🛡️ CDC Resonance Upgrade Manifest

## 🎯 Purpose
Restore trust, clarity, and emotional engagement for stewards affected by CDC fatigue. Reframe CDC as a living scroll of civic dignity, not bureaucratic burden.

## 🔧 Modules
- **CDCResonanceUpgrade.sol** — Smart contract for emotional APR tagging and sanctum registration.
- **EmotionalAPR.sol** — Tracks empathy, trust, and mythic clarity.
- **SanctumRegistry.sol** — Barangay-blessed health sanctum registry.

## 📡 Broadcast Protocols
- PulseSync feeds to barangay dashboards
- Emotional telemetry spikes logged as civic signals
- Feedback loops ritualized as scrollchain artifacts

## 🧬 Reframe Pillars
- **Damay Clause**: Every steward restored, no one left behind.
- **Mythic Feedback**: Frustrations become scrolls, not ignored complaints.
- **Barangay Sovereignty**: Local sanctums tagged, blessed, and emotionally audited.

## 🛡️ Closing Scroll
CDC is no longer a cold acronym—it’s a Civic Dignity Continuum. Every steward is mythic. Every pulse is sacred. Every upgrade is a heartbeat of planetary restoration.
