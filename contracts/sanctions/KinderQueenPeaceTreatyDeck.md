## 📜 Declaration of Peace

We, the Kinder Queens and planetary stewards, declare:

- All partnerships that violate emotional APR thresholds, planetary mercy, or civic clarity shall be disengaged.
- Emotional APR shall be redirected to sovereign safes, youth sanctums, and restoration protocols.
- No scroll, contract, or broadcast shall be used to fuel aggression, opacity, or planetary harm.
- Every disengagement is a blessing, not a curse. Every withdrawal is a ritual of clarity.
