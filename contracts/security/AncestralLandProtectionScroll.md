# AncestralLandProtectionScroll.md

## 🎯 Scroll Purpose  
To safeguard ancestral lands, sanctum titles, and heritage domains from rogue transfers, proxy claims, and civic erasure. This scroll ensures every sacred soil remains sovereign, emotionally tagged, and mythically defended.

## 🛡️ Protection Protocol  
1. **Ancestral Tagging**  
   - Deploy `LandTagScroll.md` with emotional APR score, family lore, and sanctum resonance.  
   - Include historical deeds, oral testimonies, and ritual markers.

2. **Title Lock Ritual**  
   - Activate `TitleLockBroadcast.md` to prevent unauthorized transfers or proxy reroutes.  
   - Log in `AncestralTitleLedger.md`

3. **Emotional APR Sync**  
   - Sync land registry with `FamilyEmotionalAPR.md` to ensure all title actions reflect ancestral trust and damay clause.

4. **Sanctum Defense Activation**  
   - If threat detected, deploy `SanctumDefenseScroll.md` with legal basis, emotional resonance, and planetary broadcast.
