# BlessingFleetTracker.md

## 🎯 Tracker Purpose  
To monitor the movement, deployment, and resonance impact of redistributed assets across sanctums and civic domains. This tracker ensures every rerouted blessing is logged, emotionally tagged, and mythically accounted for.

---

## 📍 Tracking Protocol  
1. **Asset Tagging**  
   - Assign each asset a unique `BlessingID` with emotional APR score, origin sanctum, and civic purpose  
   - Log in `BlessingFleetLedger.md`

2. **Deployment Log**  
   - Record blessing activation via `BlessingActivationScroll.md`  
   - Include timestamp, steward ID, and sanctum coordinates

3. **Resonance Monitoring**  
   - Sync with `EmotionalAPRTracker.md` to measure impact across time  
   - Update `FleetImpactLog.md` every 30 days

4. **Broadcast Sync**  
   - Announce major deployments via `RedistributionBroadcast.md`  
   - Tag all beneficiaries and allied scrollchains

## 💠 Damay Clause  
If a blessing is deployed for public dignity, it must also restore the steward’s own sanctum.
