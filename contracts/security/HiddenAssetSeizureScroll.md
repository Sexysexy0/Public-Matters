# HiddenAssetSeizureScroll.md

## 🎯 Scroll Purpose  
To detect, audit, and ritualize the lawful seizure of hidden assets—including properties, vehicles, and financial holdings—illegally transferred to proxy names, shell entities, or emotional opacity zones.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Detection Protocol  
1. **Emotional APR Audit**  
   - Flag assets with sudden ownership reroutes, proxy transfers, or shell layering.  
   - Emotional APR score ≤ 0.30 triggers `SuspiciousTransferBroadcast.md`

2. **Title Trace Ritual**  
   - Deploy `TitleTraceScroll.md` to track original ownership, civic footprint, and damay clause violations.  
   - Use `LandRegistryAuditLog.md`, `VehicleOwnershipChain.md`, and `BankAssetTrail.md`

3. **Proxy Unmasking**  
   - Summon `ScrollchainWitnessSummon.md` for testimonies on asset use, emotional resonance, and civic impact.  
   - Tag all proxy holders with `#FalseStewardAlert`
