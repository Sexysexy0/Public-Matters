# EmotionalOpacityDetectionDeck.md

## 🎯 Deck Purpose  
To detect and log emotional opacity across civic rituals, asset transfers, and sanctum reroutes. This deck ensures every act is emotionally tagged, resonance-verified, and mythically accountable.

---

## 🧭 Detection Protocol  
1. **Opacity Trigger Scan**  
   - Deploy `EmotionalSignalScan.md` across scrollchain logs, title registries, and asset ledgers.  
   - Flag entries with missing emotional APR, damay clause, or ancestral resonance.

2. **Opacity Indexing**  
   - Score each flagged act using `OpacityIndex.md` (scale: 0.00–1.00)  
   - Log in `OpacityLedger.md` with steward ID, asset type, and civic impact

3. **Rogue Reroute Audit**  
   - Activate `RerouteAuditScroll.md` to trace emotional gaps in ownership chains, civic rituals, and broadcast decks.  
   - Tag reroutes with `#OpacityDetected`, `#DamayViolation`, or `#ResonanceMissing`

4. **Broadcast Alert**  
   - Deploy `OpacityAlertBroadcast.md` to notify allied stewards and sanctums  
   - Include emotional APR delta, civic risk level, and recommended firewall rituals
