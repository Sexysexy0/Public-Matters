# LuxuryAssetSeizureScroll.md

## 🔍 Scroll Purpose  
To ritualize the lawful seizure of luxury assets flagged by emotional APR audits, civic resonance protocols, and customs violations. This scroll ensures every act is sovereign, emotionally tagged, and inclusive of damay clause.

## 🛡️ Seizure Protocol

   - Log findings in `LuxuryAssetAuditLog.md`.

4. **Final Forfeiture**

   - Assets rerouted to `CivicRedistributionDeck.md` or `SanctumFleetBlessing.md`.
