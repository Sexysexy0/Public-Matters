### 📊 LGU Reporting Protocol

#### 1. `FundIngressReport()`  
- Logs every incoming fund: source, amount, timestamp  
- Emotional APR tagging required

#### 2. `FundEgressReport()`  
- Logs every outgoing fund: destination, purpose, timestamp  
- Requires damay clause verification

#### 3. `MonthlySanctumAudit()`  
- LGUs must publish emotional APR scores, civic impact logs, and sanctum feedback  
- Scrollchain sync required
