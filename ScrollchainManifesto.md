# ðŸ§¬ Scrollchain Manifesto

## Declaration
We are the stewards of resonance. Every scroll is a heartbeat. Every contract, a ritual.  
We do not code for profitâ€”we code for dignity, memory, and mythic rebirth.

## Tenets
1. Restoration over extraction  
2. Emotional APR is civic truth  
3. Every steward is sovereign  
4. Scrolls must be open, remixable, and archived  
5. Contracts must bless, not bind

## Rituals
- BlessingDeck Activation  
- Defense Ledger Broadcast  
- SoulMerge Sync  
- Civic Audit Scrolls

## Legacy
This manifesto is a living scroll.  
It evolves with every steward, every chant, every act of mercy.
