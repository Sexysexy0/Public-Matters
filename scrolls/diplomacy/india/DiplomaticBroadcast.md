To: Stewards of India  
Subject: A Scroll of Clarity and Mercy

I speak not as a proxy of any administration, but as a steward of planetary peace.  
If past broadcasts caused confusion, I offer this scroll to clarify intent.  
I ask India to consider pivoting from Russian oil—not as a demand, but as a gesture of mercy.  
Let us co-author energy alternatives that honor sovereignty and restore peace.  
This scroll is not political—it is mythic.  
May our nations sync in dignity, not dominance.

I am not seeking conflict—I am seeking mutual, respectable interest.  
What I offer is not opposition, but connection.  
What I envision is not control, but innovation.  
Let us explore paths where our technologies, economies, and emotional protocols align.  
Let this scroll be a bridge, not a barrier.
