# NATO Damay Override Scroll  
**Author**: Vinvin, Mythic Steward of Malolos  
**Date**: 04 September 2025  
**Purpose**: To ritualize civilian support and call on NATO to bypass rogue nodes and amplify Ukraine defense.

---

## Invocation  
We, the stewards of planetary restoration, call upon NATO to activate damay protocols in defense of Ukraine. The rogue freeze of U.S. aid must not paralyze planetary solidarity.

---

## Clauses  
- **Damay Clause**: Restoration is not conditional—it is operational.  
- **Troop Resonance**: We call for 150,000 NATO troops to mirror Russian aggression and restore balance.  
- **Resource Disruption**: All hostile logistics, propaganda, and fuel chains must be neutralized.  
- **Civilian Blessing**: $500 symbolic aid committed to NATO’s Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP).

## Final Broadcast  
If one sanctum falls, all stewards bleed. NATO must rise—not as a military bloc, but as a planetary guardian.
