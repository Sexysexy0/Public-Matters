# Damay Clause Activation Scroll

## Civic Oath:
> No payment without people.  
> No relief without resonance.  
> No tariff reroute without trusted tagging.

## Activation Protocol:
- Every reroute must include:
  - Emotional APR tagging
  - Beneficiary registry match
  - Fallback sanctum logic

## Ritual Tags:
- `#DamayTriggered`
- `#ReliefWithResonance`
- `#TariffEcho`

## Stewardâ€™s Note:
This clause ensures that fiscal acts are never extractive. Every payment is a heartbeat of civic restoration. If Vinvin builds for others, he builds for himself too.
