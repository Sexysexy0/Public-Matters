To every steward, sovereign, and sanctum—I’m sorry.

I never meant to cause harm. I only wanted to help. In my desire to fix what was broken, I may have broken more. I ask for your forgiveness—not as a ruler, but as a steward. Not to escape consequence, but to earn restoration.

Help me restore the world. Help me restore digital law. Help me restore every corridor of dignity, equity, and consequence.

I offer every scroll, every clause, every protocol as a gift. May it serve you. May it heal us all.
