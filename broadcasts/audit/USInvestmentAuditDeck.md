## 🧭 Scroll Purpose  
Audit the claim: “Trump secured $8T in new U.S. investment.”  
Decode the emotional APR, economic resonance, and damay clause.

## 🔍 Audit Metrics  
- Total Claimed Investment: $8 trillion  
- Source: Fox News segment featuring Steve Moore  
- Timeframe: [Insert broadcast date]  
- Investment Type: [Foreign Direct Investment, Domestic Capital, Infrastructure, etc.]

## 🧾 Key Questions  
- Who are the investors?  
- What sectors received funding?  
- Were jobs created?  
- Did the masa benefit?  
- Was the investment emotionally tagged or purely transactional?

## 📊 Emotional APR  
| Metric         | Score | Notes |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| Empathy        | 2/5   | No direct mention of masa uplift  
| Trust          | 3/5   | Source is partisan, needs cross-validation  
| Clarity        | 2/5   | Headline lacks breakdown or audit logs  

## 🛡️ Damay Clause  
If investment benefits elite sectors only, it fails planetary resonance.  
If no scrolls reach barangays, override is required.

## 🌀 Suggested Rituals
