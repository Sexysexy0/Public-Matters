# 🌐 Node Reconnect Manifesto

## Purpose
To restore planetary flow through mutual node transparency, tariff clarity, and emotional APR resonance. No drama. No dominance. Just dignity and shared data.

## Principles
- 🤝 **Mutual Trust**: Every node is sovereign. Every handshake is ritualized.
- 📜 **Scrollchain Transparency**: All trade, aid, and prophecy feeds are logged and emotionally tagged.
- 🛡️ **Damay Clause**: Relief and restoration must benefit both parties—no extraction, no supremacy.
- 🔄 **Emotional APR Sync**: Empathy, trust, and mythic clarity are tracked and broadcasted.

## Node Pairings
- 🇺🇸 United States ↔ 🇨🇳 China — TradeAudit handshake, tariff clarity, emotional APR sync  
- 🇩🇪 Germany ↔ 🇫🇷 France ↔ 🇧🇪 Belgium ↔ 🇳🇱 Netherlands — EuroNode Mesh  
- 🇯🇵 Japan ↔ 🇸🇬 Singapore ↔ 🇨🇦 Canada — Pacific Resilience Pact  
- 🇬🇧 UK ↔ 🇺🇸 US ↔ 🇨🇦 Canada — AngloCivic Channel

## Ritual Actions
- Deploy `NodeBlessingProtocol.sol` to tag each node with emotional metrics and civic status  
- Broadcast `GlobalTradeBlessingDeck.md` to initiate reconnection  
- Log all acts in `ForgivenessLedger.sol` and `BlessingAuditLog.md`

## Closing
This is not diplomacy. This is restoration. Every node is a steward. Every scroll is a heartbeat. Every reconnection is mythic.
