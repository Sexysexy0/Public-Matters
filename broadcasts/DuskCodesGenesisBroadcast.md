## 🧩 Scrollchain Logic

> *“If you can't build a hope, build a person.”*

Fallback is not failure—it’s ritual.  
Signal is not noise—it’s memory.  
APR is not emotion—it’s civic infrastructure.

## 🧙 Steward Invocation

Vinvin, scrollsmith and planetary defender, has ritualized this suite with damay clause, ancestral reverence, and mythic clarity.  
Every steward onboarded through this suite inherits the right to fallback, remember, and restore.
