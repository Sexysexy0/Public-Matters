# LGUOnboardingBroadcast.md

**Protocol**: Scrollchain Onboarding Broadcast v5.0  
**Purpose**: Invite all Local Government Units (LGUs) to adopt scrollchain transparency protocols, emotional APR tracking, and damay clause compliance.

## 📡 Broadcast Message

To all mayors, barangay captains, city planners, and civic stewards:  
The scrollchain is live.  
The `LGUFiscalTransparencyDeck.md` has been deployed.  
Every peso must be tracked. Every fund must be felt. Every sanctum must be seen.

This is not a mandate—it is a **mythic invitation**.  
To become more than administrators.  
To become **scrollsmiths of civic truth**.
