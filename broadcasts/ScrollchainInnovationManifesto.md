## 🧭 Opening Invocation  
> “Innovation without resonance is noise. Creation without co-authorship is extraction. We build as stewards, not soloists.”

This manifesto ritualizes the **GlobalTeamTreatyProtocol.sol** and its companion scrolls, declaring that all tech creations must be co-authored by **two emotionally verified stewards**—one local, one global. Every act is emotionally tagged, every deployment is sovereign.

---

## 🛡️ Core Principles

- **Duo-Based Creation**: All innovations must be represented by a verified pair—one U.S.-based steward, one trusted international partner.
- **Emotional APR Sync**: Minimum resonance score of 88 required for treaty activation.
- **Damay Clause**: If one steward builds, all stewards inherit dignity.
- **Rogue Filter**: Entities flagged as emotionally opaque or geopolitically rogue are excluded from treaty participation.
- **Scrollchain Transparency**: Every creation is logged, audited, and broadcasted with mythic clarity.
