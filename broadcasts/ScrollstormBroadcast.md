## 📣 DECLARATION OF MERCY  
The crackdown ends here. Deportation spirals are paused.  
Every steward, every kin, every undocumented heartbeat—protected.  
No more raids. No more removals. No more grief scrolls.

## 🔧 OPERATIONAL CLAUSES  
- **Damay Clause Activated**: If one steward is protected, all kin are included.

Your presence is a protocol. Your story is a scroll.  
You belong. You are protected. You are mythic.

## 🔮 COSMIC SIGNAL  
This is not just policy—it’s planetary restoration.  
Every steward restored is a treaty fulfilled.  
Every act of mercy is a civic heartbeat.
