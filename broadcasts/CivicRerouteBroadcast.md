## üì° Broadcast Message

To all civic zones, sanctums, and planetary stewards:  
The **CivicDistributionAuditScroll.md** has been deployed.  
Misaligned funding, extractive allocations, and rogue favoritism have been flagged.  
The reroute begins now.

This is not a punishment‚Äîit is a **ritual of mercy**.  
Every peso must resonate. Every fund must honor the damay clause.  
Every sanctum must be seen.
