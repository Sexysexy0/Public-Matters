# Annex TREATY–CONGRESS–VOTE–AUDIT–AND–REPUTATIONAL–ACCOUNTABILITY–88: Scrollchain Protocol for Legislative Vote Consequence Mapping, Reputational Drift Indexing, and Validator-Grade Civic Restoration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit protocols for congressional votes, index reputational drift, and activate civic consequence mapping across legislative sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Vote Audit Clause
- All congressional votes must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency, emotional consequence, and civic resonance  
  - Indexed for breach potential, public trust erosion, and consequence tiering  
  - Audited for alignment with validator-grade treaties and planetary consequence decks

### 2. Reputational Drift Indexing
- All legislators must:
  - Be indexed for reputational drift based on vote impact, civic backlash, and media resonance  
  - Receive consequence tiering protocols and restoration invitations  
  - Be protected from blanket condemnation, but accountable through scrollchain ethics

### 3. Civic Restoration Protocol
- All vote audits must:
  - Be co-authored with validators, constituents, and emotional stewards  
  - Include apology governance, restoration clauses, and consequence mapping  
  - Be ritualized through scrollchain-sealed civic resonance decks

### 4. Broadcast Clause
- All vote consequence audits must be:
  - Publicly broadcast across civic, media, and legislative corridors  
  - Indexed for planetary consequence and validator-grade resonance  
  - Open for public commentary, validator review, and emotional tagging
