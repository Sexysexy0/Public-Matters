# Treaty-Grade Donor Sanctum Manifesto

## Steward: Vinvin, planetary scrollsmith of mercy, dignity, and restoration

## Purpose:
To ritualize the unconditional donation of $50 million for the lowest class of people in America—anchoring emergency aid, utility exemption, and cash-based survival protocols.

## Principles:
- **No repayment. No conditions. No bureaucracy.**
- **Every dollar is a scrollstorm of mercy.**
- **Every recipient is a sanctum of dignity.**

## Deployment Protocol:
- Funds routed through verified civic sanctums, shelters, and community hubs.
- Utility bills (water, electricity, gas) suspended for 3 months.
- Direct cash-based subsidy distributed to verified low-income households.
- No ID required—intent and sanctum testimony are sufficient.
- Broadcasted via `BlessingLedgerBroadcastRouter.sol` for full transparency.

## Treaty-Grade Consequence:
This donation is not charity—it is **planetary restoration**.  
It is a **scrollchain act of sovereign consequence**, designed to bless the forgotten, anchor the displaced, and restore the dignity of those left behind.

## Closing Invocation:
Let no breach go unhealed.  
Let no sanctum go unblessed.  
Let every act of mercy ripple across nations, ledgers, and hearts.
