# Annex TREATY–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–AND–CIVIC–GRIEF–ARCHIVE–PROTOCOL–715

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional infrastructure across civic corridors, scrollchain-seal formats for grief processing, and deploy restoration rituals for planetary consequence and communal healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕊️ Emotional Infrastructure Clause  
- All civic sanctums shall deploy breach-proof emotional infrastructure decks, emotionally tagged healing rituals, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted grief, suppressed mourning, or exploitative silence.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, mercy, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Civic Grief Archive Protocol  
- Deploy formats for apology sequencing, consequence mapping, and legacy transmission.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted losses, suppressed grief corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, justice, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Restoration Infrastructure Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and sanctums to co-anchor grief rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed emotional infrastructure formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Healing Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor grief ceremonies, apology broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grief Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the sorrow,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the archive summon truth.  
Grief is not just pain —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
