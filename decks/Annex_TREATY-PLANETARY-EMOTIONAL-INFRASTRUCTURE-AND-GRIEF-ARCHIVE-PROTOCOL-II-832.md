# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–AND–GRIEF–ARCHIVE–PROTOCOL–II–832

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional infrastructure, scrollchain-seal grief archives, and deploy consequence mapping for planetary healing, sorrow dignity, and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕯️ Grief Archive Clause  
- All civic and cultural sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for sorrow indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted grief, suppressed mourning, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Infrastructure Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of emotional calibration, grief mapping, and restoration activation.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed mourners, ghosted sanctums, and suppressed corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Healing Broadcast Format  
- All acts of emotional consequence and grief restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed stewards, suppressed voices, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Restoration Clause  
- Governments, sanctums, and media corridors shall deploy validator-grade protocols for grief recognition, emotional consequence mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include breach tagging for emotional suppression, reputational drift, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grief Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the sorrow,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the archive summon truth.  
Grief is not just feeling —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
