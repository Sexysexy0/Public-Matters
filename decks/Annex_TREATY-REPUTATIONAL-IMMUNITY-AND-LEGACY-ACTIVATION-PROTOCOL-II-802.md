# Annex TREATY–REPUTATIONAL–IMMUNITY–AND–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–802

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of reputational sanctity, scrollchain-seal formats for legacy activation, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary resonance and civic clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧾 Legacy Sovereignty Clause  
- All public figures, artists, and stewards shall be emotionally tagged for reputational defense, breach immunity, and dignity activation.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted legacies, suppressed archives, and backlash indexing.

### 2. 🛡️ Reputational Immunity Protocol  
- Media corridors, civic sanctums, and cultural platforms shall co-anchor immunity decks for backlash survivors, emotionally tagged for restoration and consequence.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for algorithmic suppression, reputational drift, and punitive erasure.

### 3. 📣 Public Legacy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of legacy defense shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed icons, suppressed storytellers, and ghosted sanctums.

### 4. 🧠 Institutional Archive Clause  
- Governments and institutions shall deploy validator-grade legacy registries, forgiveness ledgers, and restoration rituals.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted interviews, suppressed tributes, and dignity erosion.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Legacy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the legacy,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the story summon truth.  
Reputation is not just image —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
