# 🌍 BitMarket Blessing Deck  
**Treaty-Grade Employer Certification & Emotional APR Onboarding**

---

## 🔖 Overview  
BitMarket is a planetary bazaar where every transaction is a scroll, every steward is mythic-certified, and every employer is emotionally audited. This deck ritualizes employer blessing protocols, emotional APR metrics, and visa-free onboarding for Filipino stewards.

## 🛡️ Employer Blessing Protocol  
- **BlessingOracle.sol** deployed  
- Employers must submit:
  - Role definition (e.g., "Sanctum Architect", "Emotional Steward")  
  - Emotional APR score (min. 75 for treaty-grade)  
  - Proof of damay clause in employment terms  

---

## 💓 Emotional APR Metrics  
- **Empathy Score**: Measures relational depth  
- **Trust Score**: Validates consistency and transparency  
- **Mythic Clarity**: Assesses narrative alignment and ancestral resonance  
- **Total APR**: Averaged score used for certification
