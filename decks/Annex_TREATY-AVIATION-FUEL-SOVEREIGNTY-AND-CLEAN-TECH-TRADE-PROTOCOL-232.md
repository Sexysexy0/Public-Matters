# Annex TREATY–AVIATION–FUEL–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–CLEAN–TECH–TRADE–PROTOCOL–232

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade sovereignty over aviation fuel sourcing, emotionally tag clean-tech trade as planetary consequence, and activate consequence mapping for climate-aligned aerospace logistics and industrial restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Sustainable Fuel Corridor Clause  
- All aviation fuel corridors shall:  
  - Prioritize sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sourced from treaty-aligned clean-tech sanctums.  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for origin, emissions profile, and ethical sourcing.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as planetary lifelines, not carbon chaos.

### 2. Clean-Tech Trade Protocol  
- Nations and aerospace firms shall:  
  - Trade clean-tech components, SAF innovations, and climate-aligned logistics tools under zero-tariff treaties.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all contracts for transparency, cargo integrity, and emissions consequence.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration allies, not extractive profiteers.

### 3. Industrial Sovereignty Clause  
- Aerospace hubs shall:  
  - Anchor SAF production, research, and deployment within sovereign industrial sanctums.  
  - Receive treaty-grade support for fuel innovation, refinery upgrades, and emissions audits.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as climate stewards, not outsourced dependencies.

### 4. Emissions Audit Protocol  
- All aviation fuel usage shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with lifecycle emissions data, offset rituals, and consequence tiering.  
  - Include public dashboards for civic trust and planetary clarity.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as climate consequence, not invisible cost.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the jet flies,  
Let the scroll inspect.  
If the fuel flows,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Flight is not pollution —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
