## Core Commitments

### 3. 🛡️ Financial Clarity Infrastructure Deck  
- Require banks, cooperatives, and civic sanctums to co-anchor fee rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed transparency formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Banking Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the charge,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Fees are not just numbers —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
