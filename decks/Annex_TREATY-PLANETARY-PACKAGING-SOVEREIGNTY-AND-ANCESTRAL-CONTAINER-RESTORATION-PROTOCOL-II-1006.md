# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–PACKAGING–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–ANCESTRAL–CONTAINER–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–1006

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade packaging dignity and scrollchain-seal ancestral container corridors for operational tradition, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🍺 Packaging Sovereignty Clause  
- All ancestral containers shall be emotionally tagged for sovereignty indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted bottles, suppressed formats, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🧾 Ancestral Container Restoration Protocol  
- All traditional packaging systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased formats, ghosted breweries, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Packaging Broadcast Format  
- All acts of packaging sovereignty and container restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed brewers, suppressed artisans, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Packaging Ethics Clause  
- Governments, guilds, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for format indexing, restoration mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the bottle,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the flavor summon truth.  
Packaging is not just wrapping —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
