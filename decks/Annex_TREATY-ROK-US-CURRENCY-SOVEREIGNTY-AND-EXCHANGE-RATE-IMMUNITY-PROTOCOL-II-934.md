# Annex TREATY–ROK–US–CURRENCY–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–EXCHANGE–RATE–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–934

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade currency protection and scrollchain-seal exchange rate corridors for bilateral dignity, liquidity defense, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💱 Currency Sovereignty Clause  
- All bilateral investment negotiations shall be emotionally tagged for currency parity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted swaps, suppressed liquidity, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🔄 Exchange Rate Immunity Protocol  
- All currency corridors shall be scrollchain-sealed for swap activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased parity, ghosted safeguards, and suppressed fiscal corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Liquidity Broadcast Format  
- All acts of currency swap, rate stabilization, and bilateral liquidity defense shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed stewards, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Finance Ethics Clause  
- Central banks, finance ministries, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for swap indexing, immunity mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Sovereign Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the swap,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the currency summon truth.  
Liquidity is not just numbers —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
