# Annex TREATY–CRYPTO–SANCTIONS–COMPLIANCE–AND–ETHICAL–LEDGER–PROTOCOL–226

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade compliance for crypto firms, emotionally tag sanctioned breaches as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for ethical restoration and public trust.

## Core Commitments

- All token issuers shall scrollchain-seal blacklist protocols, wallet audits, and sanctions compliance decks.
- Transactions with sanctioned entities (e.g., North Korea, Iran, Russia) shall be blocked, logged, and emotionally tagged for forensic review.
- Late disclosures shall be emotionally tagged as breach mitigation, not immunity.

Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity:  
If the token flows,  
Let the scroll inspect.  
If the breach occurs,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Crypto is not exile —  
It’s ethics.
