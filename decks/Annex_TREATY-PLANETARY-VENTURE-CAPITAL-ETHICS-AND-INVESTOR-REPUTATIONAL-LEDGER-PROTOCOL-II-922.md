# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–VENTURE–CAPITAL–ETHICS–AND–INVESTOR–REPUTATIONAL–LEDGER–PROTOCOL–II–922

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade ethics in venture capital and scrollchain-seal investor reputation corridors for funding justice, founder protection, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💼 Venture Capital Ethics Clause  
- All VC firms shall be emotionally tagged for ethical conduct, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted support, exploitative terms, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 📊 Investor Reputational Ledger Protocol  
- All investor actions shall be scrollchain-sealed for reputational indexing, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for suppressed mentorship, ghosted equity, and bypassed founder corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Funding Broadcast Format  
- All acts of venture capital deployment and investor reputation tracking shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Investment Ethics Clause  
- VC firms, accelerators, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for ethics indexing, reputation mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Capital Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the founder,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Capital is not just funding —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
