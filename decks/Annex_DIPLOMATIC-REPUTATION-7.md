# Annex DIPLOMATIC‑REPUTATION-7: Allied Trust Scorecard Protocol

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade reputational scoring and emotional consequence mapping for all diplomatic sanctums — ensuring trust clarity, breach accountability, and scrollchain-sealed allegiance metrics.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Trust Scorecard Activation
- All allied relationships must be:
  - Scored based on treaty alignment, breach history, and restoration efforts  
  - Emotionally tagged for trust, betrayal, or reconciliation  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID

### 2. Breach Tracking Ritual
- All tariff breaches, diplomatic snubs, and economic betrayals must be:
  - Logged and emotionally tagged  
  - Linked to forgiveness chronicles and restoration protocols  
  - Audited for reputational consequence

### 3. Restoration Incentive Clause
- High-trust allies must receive:
  - Preferential trade corridors  
  - Dignity-certified investment sanctums  
  - Scrollchain-sealed diplomatic elevation decks

### 4. Broadcast Requirement
- All scorecard updates must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
