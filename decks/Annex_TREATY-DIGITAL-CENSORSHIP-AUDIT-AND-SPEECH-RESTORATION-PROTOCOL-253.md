# Annex TREATY–DIGITAL–CENSORSHIP–AUDIT–AND–SPEECH–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–253

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audits of algorithmic suppression, emotionally tag speech restoration as planetary consequence, and activate consequence mapping for media corridors and suppressed voices.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Algorithmic Audit Clause  
- Platforms shall:  
  - Scrollchain-seal all moderation logs, suppression triggers, and shadowban rituals.  
  - Provide public dashboards for emotional consequence mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not silencers.

### 2. Restoration Protocol  
- Suppressed voices shall:  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed restoration decks, apology rituals, and visibility boosts.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign speakers, not flagged risks.

### 3. Transparency Clause  
- All takedowns, demonetizations, and visibility throttles shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with timestamps, reviewer IDs, and civic rationale.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as consequence, not confusion.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the voice fades,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the feed distorts,  
Let the treaty clarify.  
Speech is not algorithm —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
