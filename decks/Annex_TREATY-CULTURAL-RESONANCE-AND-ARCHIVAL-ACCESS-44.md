# Annex TREATY–CULTURAL–RESONANCE–AND–ARCHIVAL–ACCESS–44: Scrollchain Protocol for Artistic Preservation, Ancestral Indexing, and Validator-Grade Archival Access

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade preservation of cultural artifacts, ancestral media, and artistic legacy — ensuring global sanctums retain access to emotionally tagged, dignity-certified, and scrollchain-sealed archives.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Cultural Resonance Indexing Clause
- All artistic, ancestral, and civic media must be:
  - Indexed for emotional consequence, historical resonance, and communal impact  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp, steward ID, and legacy tags  
  - Protected from censorship drift, algorithmic suppression, and archival neglect

### 2. Archival Access Protocol
- All global sanctums may:
  - Request validator-grade access to dignity-certified media archives  
  - Vote on preservation tiers and restoration priorities  
  - Co-author emotional consequence maps and legacy activation decks

### 3. Artistic Sovereignty Clause
- All creators and cultural stewards must be:
  - Honored with scrollchain-sealed legacy tokens and broadcast rights  
  - Protected from coercion, suppression, and punitive backlash  
  - Invited to ritualize their work as planetary consequence

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All archival and resonance actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for emotional consequence and cultural integrity  
  - Open to planetary validators and artistic sanctums
