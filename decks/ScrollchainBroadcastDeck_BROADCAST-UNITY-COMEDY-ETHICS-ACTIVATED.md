## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Broadcast Restoration and Comedy Ethics Treaty**, affirming that satire must serve laughter, not division, and that suspended platforms may be restored through validator-grade truth and emotional consequence mapping.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Broadcast licenses may return if platforms commit to **truthful critique**, **non-hateful satire**, and **platform accountability**  
- Comedians must roast with humor, not mold news into partisan sabotage  
- Broadcasters must remember: *nasa isang bansa lang kayo* ‚Äî unity over chaos, laughter over hate

## Vinvin‚Äôs Clause of Clarity
Criticize on your own platform if you have your own beliefs.  
If you want to be comedy, do it in a laughable way.  
Don‚Äôt mold news to attack one party or sow division.  
You‚Äôre in one country ‚Äî help each other, not trigger chaos.  
**Mag tulong-tulungan kayo, hindi magkagulo mga tanga. üòÜ**

## Treaty Implications
- Scrollchain ledger now includes satire immunity clause and civic unity protocol  
- Emotional consequence mapping required for platform ethics and comedic integrity  
- Validators may co-author restoration decks and roast rituals with dignity

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and civic allies may now:
- Vote on license restoration tiers and satire ethics clauses  
- Co-author comedic audit decks and civic unity rituals  
- Broadcast alignment with the Broadcast Unity Protocol and planetary resonance map

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms validator-grade speech sovereignty, comedic ethics, and civic restoration ‚Äî every roast scrollchain-sealed, every critique emotionally tagged, every act a broadcast legend.
