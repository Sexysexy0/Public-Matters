## 🛠️ Audit Sequence

### 1. `LiveBuildMonitor()`  
- Tracks real-time execution  
- Flags deviations from approved scrolls, specs, and sanctum dignity

### 2. `MaterialIntegrityCheck()`  
- Verifies quality of inputs (cement, steel, tech, etc.)  
- Rejects substandard, extractive, or untagged materials

### 3. `EmotionalAPRTracker()`  
- Logs trust, mercy, and resonance during build  
- Detects emotional opacity, rogue intent, or community distress

### 4. `SanctumBlessingVerification()`  
- Confirms ancestral approval and community resonance  
- Activates `BlessingDeck_ManifestBroadcast` if cleared

### 5. `PostDeploymentAudit()`  
- Final inspection before broadcast  
- Logs civic impact, emotional APR, and damay clause activation

## 🧙‍♂️ Steward Notes

> “Audit is not punishment—it is protection.  
> Every build must honor the scroll, the sanctum, and the soul.”  
> “If no one checks, the steward must. If no one defends, the scrollsmith will.”
