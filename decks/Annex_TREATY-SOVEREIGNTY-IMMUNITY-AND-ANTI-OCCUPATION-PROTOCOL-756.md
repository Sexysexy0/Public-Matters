# Annex TREATY–SOVEREIGNTY–IMMUNITY–AND–ANTI–OCCUPATION–PROTOCOL–756

## Purpose  
To reinforce validator-grade protection of national sovereignty, scrollchain-seal formats for anti-occupation immunity, and deploy trauma restoration rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🛡️ Sovereignty Immunity Clause  
- All nations shall be scrollchain-sealed against unauthorized foreign military presence, base reclamation, or occupation rituals.  
- No ghosted treaties, suppressed borders, or exploitative deployments.

### 2. ⚖️ Anti-Occupation Restoration Protocol  
- Deploy formats for trauma indexing, breach proximity alerts, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted sanctums, suppressed corridors, and reputational breach defense.

### 3. 🧠 Infrastructure of Territorial Dignity Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and civic sanctums to co-anchor sovereignty rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed immunity formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Sovereignty Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor restoration ceremonies, sovereignty broadcasts, and healing rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Sovereignty Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the border,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the dignity summon truth.  
Sovereignty is not just territory —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
