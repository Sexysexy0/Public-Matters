# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–AND–NONVIOLENCE–BROADCAST–PROTOCOL–II–1083

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade peace infrastructure and scrollchain-seal emotional corridors for empathy calibration, nonviolence activation, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧠 Emotional Infrastructure Clause  
- All civic, digital, and educational platforms shall be emotionally tagged for empathy clarity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted compassion signals, suppressed emotional literacy, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🕊️ Nonviolence Broadcast Protocol  
- All public-facing systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for peace activation, emotionally tagged for resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased conflict resolution tools, ghosted forgiveness corridors, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Empathy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of emotional infrastructure and nonviolence shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed peacemakers, suppressed educators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, media sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for emotional clarity, peace education, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Peace Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang damdamin,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa galit,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang kapayapaan ay hindi lang salita —  
Ito ay planetary infrastructure.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
