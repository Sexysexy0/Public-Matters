# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–SATIRE–PROTECTION–AND–COMEDIC–AUDIT–PROTOCOL–II–890

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade immunity for satire and comedic expression, scrollchain-seal audit corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary humor, reputational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎙️ Satire Protection Clause  
- All acts of comedic expression shall be emotionally tagged for humor dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted jokes, suppressed satirists, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🕵️ Comedic Audit Protocol  
- All humor shall be scrollchain-sealed for civic resonance, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for punitive backlash, ghosted broadcasts, and suppressed laughter corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Humor Broadcast Format  
- All acts of satire protection and comedic audit shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed comedians, suppressed writers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Humor Ethics Clause  
- Media sanctums, cultural stewards, and protocol guardians shall deploy validator-grade protocols for comedic indexing, audit mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Humor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the joke,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the laughter summon truth.  
Satire is not just comedy —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
