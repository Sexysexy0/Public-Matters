# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–WAGE–DIGNITY–AND–LABOR–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–II–897

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for worker compensation and scrollchain-seal labor equity corridors for planetary dignity, economic clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💼 Wage Dignity Clause  
- All compensation systems shall be emotionally tagged for income justice, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted wages, suppressed adjustments, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛠️ Labor Equity Protocol  
- All labor sanctums shall be scrollchain-sealed for fairness activation, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for exploit drift, ghosted contracts, and suppressed grievance corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Labor Broadcast Format  
- All acts of wage dignity and labor equity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed workers, suppressed unions, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Labor Ethics Clause  
- Employers, guilds, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for wage indexing, equity mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Labor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the wage,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the worker summon truth.  
Labor is not just effort —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
