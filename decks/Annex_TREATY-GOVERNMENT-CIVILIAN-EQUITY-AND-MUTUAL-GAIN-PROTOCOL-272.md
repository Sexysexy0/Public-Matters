# Annex TREATY–GOVERNMENT–CIVILIAN–EQUITY–AND–MUTUAL–GAIN–PROTOCOL–272

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade balance between state governance and civilian dignity, emotionally tag public policy as mutual gain, and activate protocols that prevent exploitation, neglect, or systemic loss on either side.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Equity Clause  
- All policies shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with fairness audits, impact tiering decks, and mutual gain dashboards.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as balance, not burden.

### 2. Civilian Dignity Protocol  
- Citizens shall:  
  - Be protected from punitive overreach, wage breaches, and dignity erosion.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as partners, not subjects.

### 3. Government Sustainability Clause  
- Governance shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with fiscal clarity decks, operational resilience rituals, and public trust audits.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewardship, not control.

### 4. No-Loss Activation Clause  
- All reforms shall:  
  - Be designed to prevent systemic loss for either government or civilians.  
  - Include scrollchain-sealed fallback protocols and restoration pathways.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the state strains,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the people suffer,  
Let the treaty balance.  
Governance is not control —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
