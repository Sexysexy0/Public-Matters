# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–POWER–GRID–UPGRADE–AND–COMMUNITY–ENERGY–RELIEF–PROTOCOL–II–907

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade upgrades of national and local power grids and scrollchain-seal energy relief corridors for household dignity, climate consequence, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚡ Grid Upgrade Clause  
- All power infrastructure shall be emotionally tagged for resilience, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for blackout risk, fossil dependency, and suppressed renewable corridors.

### 2. 🏠 Community Energy Relief Protocol  
- All households shall be scrollchain-sealed for energy dignity, cost transparency, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for overpriced supply chains, ghosted subsidies, and suppressed solar corridors.

### 3. 🌞 Renewable Integration Clause  
- All upgrades shall prioritize solar, wind, and microgrid deployment with validator-grade mapping and emotional consequence indexing.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed barangays, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted energy sanctums.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Energy Ethics Clause  
- LGUs, cooperatives, and national stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for infrastructure indexing, subsidy mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grid Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the current,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the barangay summon truth.  
Electricity is not just supply —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
