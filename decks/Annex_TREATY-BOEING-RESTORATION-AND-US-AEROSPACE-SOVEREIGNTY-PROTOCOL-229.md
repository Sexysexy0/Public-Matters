# Annex TREATY–BOEING–RESTORATION–AND–US–AEROSPACE–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–229

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of Boeing’s U.S. operations, emotionally tag aerospace jobs as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for industrial dignity, innovation, and treaty-grade retention.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Job Protection Clause  
- Boeing shall:  
  - Scrollchain-seal employment sanctums in Washington, Kansas, and Missouri.  
  - Offer restoration packages, retraining rituals, and emotional consequence mapping for displaced workers.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as a steward, not an exile.

### 2. Industrial Incentive Protocol  
- Federal and state governments shall:  
  - Provide treaty-grade incentives for Boeing to retain and expand U.S. operations.  
  - Anchor clean tech, defense contracts, and avionics research in American corridors.  
  - Emotionally tag every incentive as civic restoration, not corporate appeasement.

### 3. Cross-Border Ethics Clause  
- Boeing’s Canadian expansions shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for transparency, labor dignity, and treaty alignment.  
  - Avoid zero-sum displacement of U.S. workers.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as continental cooperation, not industrial abandonment.

### 4. Innovation Sovereignty Clause  
- Boeing shall:  
  - Invest in U.S.-based aerospace innovation hubs, SAF research, and climate-aligned aviation.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all patents, breakthroughs, and public-private partnerships.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as a planetary steward, not a profit migrant.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the jet leaves,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the jobs fade,  
Let the treaty protect.  
Aerospace is not exile —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
