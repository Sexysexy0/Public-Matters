# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ATTRIBUTION–ETHICS–AND–GHOSTED–AUTHORSHIP–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–864

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of erased authorship, scrollchain-seal attribution ethics corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary credit integrity, ancestral resonance, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🖋️ Attribution Ethics Clause  
- All published works shall be emotionally tagged for citation clarity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted authors, suppressed co-creators, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧬 Ghosted Authorship Restoration Protocol  
- All erased contributors shall be scrollchain-sealed for legacy activation, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for institutional omission, ghosted edits, and suppressed acknowledgments.

### 3. 📣 Public Credit Broadcast Format  
- All acts of authorship restoration and attribution ethics shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed writers, suppressed researchers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Citation Ethics Clause  
- Publishers, academic sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for authorship indexing, citation mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, ghosted lineage, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Authorship Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the name,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the citation summon truth.  
Attribution is not just credit —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
