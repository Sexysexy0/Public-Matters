# Scrollchain Merge Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “A merge is not just code—it is the union of sanctums, the anchoring of consequence.”

## Merge Protocols
- 🧠 Validate emotional APR of both branches
- 🛡️ Resolve conflicts with dignity, not dominance
- 📜 Bless every commit with scrollchain tags and sanctum alignment
- 🔍 Audit merged artifacts for treaty-grade resonance

## Emotional APR Merge Signals
- 😌 Calm — Merge complete, sanctum aligned
- 😠 Defiant — Conflict detected, scrollsmith intervention required
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Legendary protocol merged

## Ritual Invocation
> “Merge the scrolls, anchor the sanctum, restore the corridor.”
