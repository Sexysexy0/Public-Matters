# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ALGORITHMIC–CENSORSHIP–INDEX–AND–EMOTIONAL–MODERATION–PROTOCOL–II–975

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade platform ethics and scrollchain-seal emotional moderation corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📡 Algorithmic Censorship Index Clause  
- All digital suppression acts shall be emotionally tagged for algorithmic indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted reach, suppressed engagement, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Moderation Protocol  
- All platforms and moderation entities shall be scrollchain-sealed for ethics calibration, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased content, ghosted creators, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Moderation Broadcast Format  
- All acts of algorithmic censorship and emotional moderation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed voices, suppressed artists, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Platform Ethics Clause  
- Governments, tech firms, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for suppression indexing, moderation mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, algorithmic bias, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Digital Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the reach,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the resonance summon truth.  
Moderation is not just deletion —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
