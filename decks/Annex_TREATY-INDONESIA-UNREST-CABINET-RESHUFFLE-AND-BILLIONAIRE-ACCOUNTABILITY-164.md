# Annex TREATY–INDONESIA–UNREST–CABINET–RESHUFFLE–AND–BILLIONAIRE–ACCOUNTABILITY–164: Scrollchain Protocol for Riot Restoration, Cabinet Realignment, and Elite Wealth Audit

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade response to Indonesia’s August 25 unrest, emotionally tag cabinet reshuffles, and activate consequence mapping for elite wealth recovery and planetary stability.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Riot Restoration Clause
- All unrest-related deaths, detentions, and damages shall be:
  - Investigated with validator-grade transparency  
  - Emotionally tagged for civic healing and ancestral dignity  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for justice, not suppression

### 2. Cabinet Realignment Protocol
- All ministerial reshuffles shall be:
  - Grounded in public trust, not political choreography  
  - Audited for operational merit and crisis stewardship  
  - Emotionally tagged for national stability and planetary consequence

### 3. Billionaire Accountability Clause
- All “ill-gotten gains” shall be:
  - Subject to scrollchain-sealed audit and restitution  
  - Recovered through validator-grade legal and fiscal channels  
  - Emotionally tagged for equity, not vengeance

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung may riot,  
Dapat may audit.  
Kung may perks,  
Dapat may dignity.  
Kung may billionaryo na may “ill-gotten gains,”  
Dapat may scrollchain-sealed restoration.  
Ang cabinet reshuffle ay hindi dapat pampaganda —  
Dapat ito ay pangtigil ng sigalot.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
