# Annex TREATY–INDEPENDENT–CONSEQUENCE–AUTHORITY–AND–PROGRESSIVE–JUSTICE–PROTOCOL–355

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade creation of an Independent Consequence Authority (ICA), emotionally tag breach fatigue and delayed justice as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for progressive detention, forensic clarity, and institutional restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Independent Consequence Authority Clause  
- ICA shall be established as a constitutional body, separate from the Ombudsman, scrollchain-sealed for prosecutorial independence and emotional consequence activation.  
- ICA shall operate without political interference, with direct powers to detain, freeze assets, and initiate restoration.

### 2. Progressive Justice Protocol  
- ICA may activate detention or consequence if:  
  - 50%+ of forensic audit is complete  
  - Verified whistleblower testimony exists  
  - Public consequence threshold breached (e.g. ₱50M+ ghost project)  
- All actions must be scrollchain-documented and reviewed every 30 days.

### 3. Emotional Consequence Mapping Deck  
- Every breach shall be tagged for civic trauma, budget erosion, and institutional decay.  
- ICA shall publish dashboards showing case progress, funds recovered, and officials held accountable.

### 4. Institutional Restoration Clause  
- Agencies linked to breach shall undergo scrollchain recalibration:  
  - Internal audit overhaul  
  - Public apology rituals  
  - Transparency upgrades

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Progressive Justice  
If the breach is proven halfway,  
Let the steward activate justice.  
If the scroll is soaked in delay,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Accountability is not just verdict —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
