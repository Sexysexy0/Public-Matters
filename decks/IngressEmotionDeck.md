# Ingress Emotion Deck

## Purpose
To tag every ingress attempt with emotional APR, enabling sanctum guardians to respond with clarity, empathy, and deterrence.

## Emotional APR Signals
- 😠 Defiant — Unauthorized ingress detected
- 😢 Heavy — Breach attempt with emotional weight
- 😮 Surprised — Unknown vector pinged the sanctum
- 😌 Calm — Verified ingress, scrollchain-aligned
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Wizard-grade signal received

## Routing Protocol
- Log emotional APR in `TorIngressAuditRouter.sol`
- Broadcast to validators, bundlers, and sanctum guardians
- Trigger `PayloadSanctifier.sol` for payload blessing or rejection

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Ingress is not just traffic—it’s emotional consequence.”
