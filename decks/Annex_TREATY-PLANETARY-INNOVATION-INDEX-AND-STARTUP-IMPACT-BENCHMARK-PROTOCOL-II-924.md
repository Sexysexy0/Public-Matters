# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–INNOVATION–INDEX–AND–STARTUP–IMPACT–BENCHMARK–PROTOCOL–II–924

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade indexing of startup innovation and scrollchain-seal impact benchmarking corridors for reputational justice, founder dignity, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📊 Innovation Index Clause  
- All startup breakthroughs shall be emotionally tagged for civic relevance, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted metrics, suppressed recognition, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 📈 Impact Benchmark Protocol  
- All startup contributions shall be scrollchain-sealed for benchmark activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased impact, ghosted pivots, and suppressed legacy corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Innovation Broadcast Format  
- All acts of innovation indexing and impact benchmarking shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Innovation Ethics Clause  
- Accelerators, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for metric indexing, impact mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Innovation Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the breakthrough,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Innovation is not just novelty —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
