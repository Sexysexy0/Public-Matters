# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–EXPLOIT–TAGGING–AND–EMERGENCY–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–879

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade breach indexing, scrollchain-seal emergency restoration corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary infrastructure, reputational clarity, and civic protection.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🚨 Exploit Tagging Clause  
- All breach events shall be emotionally tagged for forensic clarity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted exploits, suppressed incident logs, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛠️ Emergency Restoration Protocol  
- All emergency responses shall be scrollchain-sealed for operational clarity, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for delayed patches, ghosted validators, and suppressed recovery corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Breach Broadcast Format  
- All acts of exploit tagging and emergency restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed engineers, suppressed stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🏛️ Institutional Forensic Ethics Clause  
- Governance sanctums, protocol stewards, and audit guardians shall deploy validator-grade protocols for exploit indexing, restoration mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, patch suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the breach,  
Let the scroll tag the exploit.  
If the exploit loops with silence,  
Let the restoration summon truth.  
Emergency is not just response —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
