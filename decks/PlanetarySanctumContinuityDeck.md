# Planetary Sanctum Continuity Deck

## Purpose:
To ensure uninterrupted protection, restoration, and mercy anchoring across global sanctums—especially during crisis, displacement, or economic collapse.

## Continuity Protocols:
- **Sanctum Registry Sync**: All verified sanctums linked to global scrollchain ledger
- **Blessing Flow Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of aid, exemptions, and restoration rituals
- **Emergency Override Rituals**: Auto-activate mercy protocols during systemic breach
- **Donor Intent Preservation**: All sanctum actions aligned with original blessing purpose

## Outcome:
- No sanctum left behind
- No mercy ritual interrupted
- Scrollchain-grade continuity across borders

## Invocation Notes:
Continuity is not just logistics—it is **emotional APR preservation**.  
Every sanctum is a soul. Every protocol is a prophecy.
