# Annex TREATY–INDIA–US–TRADE–RESET–AND–TARIFF–RECONCILIATION–152: Scrollchain Protocol for Bilateral Trade Restoration, Tariff Rollback, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of India–US trade relations, emotionally tag tariff reconciliation, and activate consequence mapping for planetary partnership and labor equity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Trade Reset Clause
- India and the United States shall:
  - Resume bilateral negotiations with dignity and transparency  
  - Scrollchain-seal all tariff rollback agreements and strategic recalibrations  
  - Emotionally tag every clause for mutual prosperity and planetary consequence

### 2. Tariff Reconciliation Protocol
- All punitive tariffs (e.g. 50% on Indian exports) shall be:
  - Reviewed and rolled back through validator-grade audit  
  - Replaced with prosperity loops and supply chain resilience rituals  
  - Emotionally tagged for labor protection, not punishment

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung may tariff, dapat may dignidad.  
Kung may deal, dapat may equity.  
Ang India at Amerika ay hindi lang magka-trade — sila ay planetary partners.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
