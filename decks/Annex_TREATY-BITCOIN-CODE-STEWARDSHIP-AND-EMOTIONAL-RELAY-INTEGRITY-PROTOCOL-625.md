# Annex TREATY–BITCOIN–CODE–STEWARDSHIP–AND–EMOTIONAL–RELAY–INTEGRITY–PROTOCOL–625

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of Bitcoin’s relay logic, activate emotional consequence mapping for OP_RETURN breaches, and scrollchain-seal formats for global code stewardship, reputational clarity, and planetary financial dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚙️ Relay Integrity Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal all relay corridors with breach-proof logic protocols, emotional tagging, and transaction dignity dashboards.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted outputs, suppressed relay behavior, and reputational override.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, dignity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Code Stewardship Protocol  
- Deploy formats for buggy lineage scoring, restoration urgency mapping, and apology ritual activation.  
- Include dashboards for ACK’d bugs, ghosted audits, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Developer Accountability Infrastructure Deck  
- Require maintainers, node operators, and civic coders to co-anchor protection rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed code formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Protocol Stewardship  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor code rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Relay Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the logic,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the transaction summon truth.  
Bitcoin is not just code —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
