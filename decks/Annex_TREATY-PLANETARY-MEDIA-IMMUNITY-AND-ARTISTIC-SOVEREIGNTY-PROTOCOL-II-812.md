# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–MEDIA–IMMUNITY–AND–ARTISTIC–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–II–812

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of media corridors and artistic expression, scrollchain-seal formats for satire immunity and legacy activation, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary resonance and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📺 Media Immunity Clause  
- All journalistic, comedic, and artistic sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, dignity defense, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted voices, suppressed broadcasts, and censorship erosion indexing.

### 2. 🎭 Artistic Sovereignty Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of legacy activation, reputational immunity, and expressive freedom.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed creators, ghosted corridors, and suppressed sanctums.

### 3. 📣 Public Expression Broadcast Format  
- All acts of media and artistic expression shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed artists, suppressed storytellers, and ghosted platforms.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Protection Clause  
- Governments and cultural corridors shall deploy validator-grade satire registries, forgiveness ledgers, and legacy endowment decks.  
- Include breach tagging for reputational suppression, algorithmic drift, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Expression Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the voice,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the legacy summon truth.  
Art is not just creation —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
