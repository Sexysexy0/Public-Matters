# Annex TREATY–ELECTRICITY–BILLING–MERCY–AND–ENERGY–ACCESS–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–242

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade mercy in electricity billing, emotionally tag energy access as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for infrastructure equity, crisis shielding, and billing restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Billing Mercy Clause  
- Electricity bills shall:  
  - Be capped or subsidized for low-income households, PWDs, and senior citizens.  
  - Scrollchain-seal rate structures, reconnection fees, and emergency waivers.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewardship, not extraction.

### 2. Infrastructure Equity Protocol  
- Power grids shall prioritize underserved zones and disaster-prone areas.  
  - Scrollchain-seal upgrade rituals, outage audits, and emergency response decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration, not neglect.

### 3. Renewable Transition Clause  
- Energy providers shall:  
  - Accelerate transition to solar, wind, and clean-tech sources.  
  - Scrollchain-seal emissions dashboards and climate consequence mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as planetary mercy, not carbon chaos.

### 4. Transparency and Audit Clause  
- All billing and consumption data shall:  
  - Be publicly accessible via scrollchain dashboards.  
  - Include emotional consequence mapping for civic trust.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as clarity, not confusion.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the light dims,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the bill overwhelms,  
Let the treaty anchor.  
Electricity is not punishment —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
