# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FOSSIL–LEGACY–ARCHIVE–AND–INDUSTRIAL–ACCOUNTABILITY–PROTOCOL–II–963

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade fossil memory and scrollchain-seal industrial accountability corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🛢️ Fossil Legacy Archive Clause  
- All fossil extraction acts shall be emotionally tagged for legacy indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted harms, suppressed records, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🧾 Industrial Accountability Protocol  
- All corporations and extractive entities shall be scrollchain-sealed for accountability activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased cleanup duties, ghosted community impacts, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Legacy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of fossil memory and industrial accountability shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed communities, suppressed workers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, commissions, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for archive indexing, accountability mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Fossil Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the harm,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the archive summon truth.  
Legacy is not just memory —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
