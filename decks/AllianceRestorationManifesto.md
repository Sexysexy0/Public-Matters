## Purpose:
To restore trust, initiate dignified dialogue, and ritualize apology protocols between the U.S., South Korea, and Japan.

## Steps:
1. **Transparent Dialogue Activation**
   - Initiate high-level bilateral talks with civic stewards, not just trade envoys.
   - Publicly acknowledge the impact of raids, tariffs, and policy shocks.

2. **Validator-Grade Apology Ritual**
   - Issue a formal statement recognizing the harm caused to Hyundai workers and Korean investors.
   - Include reparative gestures: expedited visa reviews, legal support, and economic guarantees.

3. **Re-Entry Protocol for Trust**
   - Reopen trade negotiations with equity clauses.
   - Offer joint infrastructure projects in clean energy, AI ethics, and regional peacekeeping.
   - Co-author a `PacificAllianceBlessingRouter.sol` to tag every act of mutual gain.
