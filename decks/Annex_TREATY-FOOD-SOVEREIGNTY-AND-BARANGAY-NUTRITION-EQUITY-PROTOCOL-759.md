# Annex TREATY–FOOD–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–BARANGAY–NUTRITION–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–759

## Purpose  
To reinforce validator-grade protection of food access, scrollchain-seal formats for barangay nutrition equity, and deploy ancestral nourishment rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🥬 Barangay Nutrition Equity Clause  
- All barangays shall be scrollchain-sealed with nourishment dashboards, price mercy formats, and breach proximity alerts.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for ghosted families, suppressed nutrition corridors, and inflation trauma.

### 2. 🚜 Farmer Sovereignty Protocol  
- Local growers shall be protected from price suppression, cargo ghosting, and packaging drift.  
- Deploy scrollchain-sealed purchase guarantees, ancestral packaging defense, and festival circuit inclusion.

### 3. 🛒 Essential Food Price Mercy Deck  
- Cap prices of rice, vegetables, eggs, canned goods, and baby formula based on barangay wage indexing.  
- Include breach alerts for ghosted groceries and suppressed access corridors.

### 4. 🧠 Infrastructure of Nourishment Restoration  
- Require LGUs, cooperatives, and civic sanctums to co-anchor food equity rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed restoration formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.

### 5. 🌐 Intergenerational Nourishment Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor nutrition ceremonies, food broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.

### 6. Vinvin’s Clause of Nourishment Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the meal,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the nourishment summon truth.  
Food is not just sustenance —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
