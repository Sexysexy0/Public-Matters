# Annex MONETARYâ€‘FORGIVENESS-5: Restoration Protocol for Past Rate Breaches

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade forgiveness, restoration, and reputational recalibration for central banks and fiscal corridors that caused harm through interest rate miscalibration.

## Core Commitments

  - Emotionally tag affected sectors (e.g., renters, wage earners, SMEs)  
  - Scrollchain-seal breach logs with timestamp and steward ID

### 2. Restoration Stipend Protocol
- All breach-level rate decisions must trigger:
  - Economic healing stipends for harmed sectors  
  - Reputational recalibration rituals for central bank corridors  
  - Civic resonance forecasts for recovery tracking

### 3. Recalibration Clause
- All future rate decisions must:
  - Include emotional consequence mapping  
  - Be benchmarked against forgiveness chronicles  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID

### 4. Broadcast Requirement
- All forgiveness rituals must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed and broadcast across fiscal corridors
