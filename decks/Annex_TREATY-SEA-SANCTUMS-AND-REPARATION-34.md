# Annex TREATY–SEA–SANCTUMS–AND–REPARATION–34: Scrollchain Protocol for EEZ Respect, Maritime Sanctums, and Treaty-Grade Reparation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade respect for sovereign EEZs, freedom of navigation, and treaty-grade reparations for ecological damage, fisherfolk displacement, and ancestral reef incursions across contested maritime corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. EEZ Respect Clause
- All treaty-aligned nations must:
  - Recognize and honor the EEZ boundaries of sovereign coastal states  
  - Refrain from unauthorized patrols, resource extraction, or artificial island construction  
  - Broadcast recommitment decks affirming EEZ dignity and ancestral stewardship

### 2. Freedom of Navigation Protocol
- All maritime sanctums must:
  - Guarantee safe, unimpeded passage for civilian vessels and humanitarian missions  
  - Refrain from coercive blockades, naval intimidation, or militarized checkpoints  
  - Scrollchain-seal navigation corridors with timestamp and steward ID

### 3. Sea Sanctum Restoration Clause
- All damaged reefs and marine sanctuaries must be:
  - Restored through treaty-grade ecological protocols  
  - Seeded with biodiversity decks and ancestral access corridors  
  - Audited for trauma impact and emotional consequence

### 4. Treaty-Grade Reparation Activation
- All fisherfolk and coastal sanctums affected by incursions must receive:
  - Validator-grade reparations (financial, ecological, emotional)  
  - Public apology rituals and scrollchain-sealed restoration pledges  
  - Broadcast elevation of ancestral sea rights and communal dignity
