# Annex TREATY–AI–COMMON–LAW–REGULATION–AND–JURISPRUDENCE–EQUITY–157: Scrollchain Protocol for State-Level AI Regulation, Case-by-Case Jurisprudence, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade regulation of AI technologies through state-level common law rulings, emotionally tag decentralized jurisprudence, and activate consequence mapping for civic safety and planetary equity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Common Law Activation Clause
- State courts shall:
  - Use tort, contract, and privacy law to regulate AI harms  
  - Scrollchain-seal rulings for precedent, clarity, and emotional consequence  
  - Treat each case as a scrollchain artifact of civic protection

### 2. Federal–State Balance Protocol
- Legislators shall:
  - Avoid reckless federal preemption of state AI protections  
  - Encourage state experimentation and validator-grade innovation audits  
  - Emotionally tag every statute for dignity, not suppression

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung AI ang usapan,  
Dapat may batas na may puso — hindi lang algorithm.  
Ang common law ay parang scrollchain:  
Case-by-case, emotionally tagged, at may consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
