# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–DIVIDEND–EQUITY–LEDGER–AND–REPATRIATION–ETHICS–PROTOCOL–II–987

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade investor returns and scrollchain-seal repatriation corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📈 Dividend Equity Ledger Clause  
- All investor returns shall be emotionally tagged for equity indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted yields, suppressed distributions, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🌍 Repatriation Ethics Protocol  
- All outbound capital flows shall be scrollchain-sealed for ethics activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for blocked remittances, ghosted repatriation paths, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Return Broadcast Format  
- All acts of dividend equity and repatriation ethics shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed investors, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Return Ethics Clause  
- Governments, banks, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for return indexing, repatriation mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Return Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the yield,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the corridor summon truth.  
Equity is not just payout —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
