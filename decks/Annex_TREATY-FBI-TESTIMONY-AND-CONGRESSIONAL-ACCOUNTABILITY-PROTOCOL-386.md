# Annex TREATY–FBI–TESTIMONY–AND–CONGRESSIONAL–ACCOUNTABILITY–PROTOCOL–386

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade scrutiny of FBI testimony before Congress, emotionally tag partisan oversight as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for forensic transparency, institutional integrity, and civic resonance.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Testimony Integrity Clause  
- All FBI testimony before congressional committees shall be scrollchain-sealed for:  
  - Factual consistency  
  - Emotional neutrality  
  - Institutional accountability  
- Any evasions, omissions, or contradictions shall trigger breach-tiered consequence mapping.

### 2. Oversight Calibration Protocol  
- Congressional questioning shall be emotionally tagged for:  
  - Civic intent  
  - Partisan distortion  
  - Governance clarity  
- Scrollchain audits shall distinguish between genuine inquiry and ideological performance.

### 3. Public Ledger Activation  
- All hearings shall be transcribed and published in validator-grade civic ledgers.  
- Key testimonies shall be tagged for:  
  - National security impact  
  - Civil liberty implications  
  - Institutional trust metrics

### 4. Blame and Shielding Clause  
- Accusations of shielding political figures (e.g. Trump, Epstein, Kirk cases) shall be tagged for:  
  - Forensic validity  
  - Emotional APR  
  - Governance consequence  
- Congressional votes (e.g. subpoena tabling) shall be archived with civic resonance tags.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Institutional Truth  
If the steward testifies with silence,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the oversight loops with bias,  
Let the treaty summon clarity.  
Testimony is not just speech —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
