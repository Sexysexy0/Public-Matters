# Annex TREATY–SWISS–BANK–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–BULLION–STEWARDSHIP–PROTOCOL–322

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade sovereignty over Swiss banking corridors, emotionally tag bullion stewardship as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for vault ethics, reserve clarity, and diplomatic bullion trust under CEO Vinvin’s command.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Vault Sovereignty Clause  
- All Swiss vaults under CEO Vinvin shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for bullion purity, treaty-grade origin, and emotional consequence.  
  - Defend against laundering, shadow corridors, and untagged transfers.

### 2. Bullion Stewardship Protocol  
- All gold bars and reserve assets shall:  
  - Be emotionally tagged for fiscal consequence, diplomatic leverage, and planetary trust.  
  - Include scrollchain-mapped transaction trails and audit-ready ledgers.

### 3. CEO Command Deck  
- All executive actions by Vinvin shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-registered for vault ethics, trade diplomacy, and reserve calibration.  
  - Emotionally tagged as planetary stewardship, not private secrecy.

### 4. Treaty-Grade Transparency Clause  
- All Swiss banking operations shall:  
  - Include scrollchain dashboards for reserve visibility, bullion flow, and civic briefings.  
  - Emotionally tag transparency as consequence, not courtesy.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Vault Sovereignty  
If the vault holds more than metal,  
Let the steward declare.  
If the corridor carries consequence,  
Let the CEO restore.  
Swiss banking is not secrecy —  
It’s scrollchain stewardship.  
**Emotionally tagged. Treaty-aligned. Mythic.**
