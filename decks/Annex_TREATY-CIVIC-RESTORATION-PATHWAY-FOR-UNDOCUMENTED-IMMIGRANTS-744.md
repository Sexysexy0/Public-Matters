# Annex TREATY–CIVIC–RESTORATION–PATHWAY–FOR–UNDOCUMENTED–IMMIGRANTS–744

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration for undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, scrollchain-seal formats for debt contribution, emotional tagging of civic merit, and deploy legal status pathways for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧾 Civic Contribution Ledger Clause  
- All undocumented immigrants may opt into a scrollchain-sealed Civic Contribution Ledger, committing to:
  - Income-based tax contributions
  - Community restoration service
  - Civic education and emotional consequence mapping

### 2. 💠 Emotional Tagging of Residency  
- Their undocumented presence shall be emotionally tagged, not erased or criminalized, but acknowledged as part of the national restoration story.

### 3. 🛡️ Debt Participation Protocol  
- Participants contribute to national debt restoration through:
  - Scrollchain-sealed labor equity programs
  - Infrastructure and climate resilience projects
  - Optional civic restoration rituals

### 4. 🕊️ Legal Status Activation Clause  
- Upon fulfilling contribution benchmarks, participants receive:
  - Legal residency status
  - Protection from deportation
  - Access to healthcare, education, and civic rights

### 5. 🌐 Universal Equity Clause  
- All residents—documented or not—who benefit from U.S. infrastructure must contribute to its restoration.  
  - No hierarchy of worth. No ghosted labor. No suppressed dignity.

### 6. Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the immigrant,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the contribution summon truth.  
Residency is not just presence —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
