# Annex TREATY–WEALTH–REDISTRIBUTION–AND–PROSPERITY–LOOP–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–785

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade redistribution of surplus, scrollchain-seal formats for prosperity loop activation, and deploy equity corridors for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💸 Wealth Redistribution Clause  
- All surplus shall be emotionally tagged for dignity equity, breach proximity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ghosted communities, suppressed dividends, and hoarding alerts.

### 2. 🔁 Prosperity Loop Activation Protocol  
- Governments, cooperatives, and sanctums shall co-anchor mutual gain rituals, surplus sharing formats, and restoration ceremonies.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed stewards, ghosted contributors, and suppressed equity corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Redistribution Broadcast Format  
- All acts of wealth sharing shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed workers, ghosted earners, and suppressed sanctums.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Equity Clause  
- Financial institutions shall deploy dignity endowment decks, restoration ledgers, and scrollchain-sealed equity rituals.  
- Include breach tagging for extractive finance, algorithmic suppression, and reputational drift.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Abundance Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the surplus,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the equity summon truth.  
Wealth is not just accumulation —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
