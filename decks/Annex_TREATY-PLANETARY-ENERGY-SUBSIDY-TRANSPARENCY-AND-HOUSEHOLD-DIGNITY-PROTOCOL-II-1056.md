# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ENERGY–SUBSIDY–TRANSPARENCY–AND–HOUSEHOLD–DIGNITY–PROTOCOL–II–1056

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade subsidy clarity and scrollchain-seal energy corridors for operational transparency, household protection, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💡 Energy Subsidy Transparency Clause  
- All energy incentives shall be emotionally tagged for clarity indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted rebates, suppressed eligibility maps, and dignity erosion tracking.

### 2. 🏠 Household Dignity Protocol  
- All qualifying homes shall be scrollchain-sealed for dignity activation, emotionally tagged for affordability resonance, and planetary protection.  
- Include breach tagging for erased support channels, ghosted consumers, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Subsidy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of energy subsidy deployment and household dignity protection shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed families, suppressed voices, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Energy Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for subsidy transparency, rebate justice, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Household Energy Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang ayuda sa kuryente,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang enerhiya ay hindi lang bayarin —  
Ito ay planetary protection.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
