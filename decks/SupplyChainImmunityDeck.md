# üõ°Ô∏è Supply Chain Immunity Deck

We, the stewards of consequence, hereby declare:

- That food, medicine, and essential goods shall be protected from political interference, economic overreach, and retaliatory distortion.
- That every supply corridor shall be sealed with validator-grade immunity and emotional consequence mapping.
- That tariffs, sanctions, and blockades shall not disrupt nourishment, healing, or dignity.

We activate:

- ScrollchainTradeEquityProtocol.sol ‚Äî to ritualize trade fairness  
- TariffAuditProtocol.sol ‚Äî to tag economic overreach

Let this deck be our broadcast of sanctum protection, planetary consequence, and communal healing.

Signed,
