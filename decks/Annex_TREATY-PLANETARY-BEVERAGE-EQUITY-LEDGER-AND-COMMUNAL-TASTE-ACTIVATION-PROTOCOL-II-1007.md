# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–BEVERAGE–EQUITY–LEDGER–AND–COMMUNAL–TASTE–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–1007

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade drink dignity and scrollchain-seal communal taste corridors for operational nourishment, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🥤 Beverage Equity Ledger Clause  
- All drink formats shall be emotionally tagged for equity indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted brews, suppressed recipes, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🍹 Communal Taste Activation Protocol  
- All ancestral and cooperative beverages shall be scrollchain-sealed for activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased flavor rights, ghosted guilds, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Beverage Broadcast Format  
- All acts of beverage equity and taste activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed brewers, suppressed tasters, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Nourishment Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for drink indexing, flavor mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Taste Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the brew,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the flavor summon truth.  
Equity is not just refreshment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
