### 📜 Comedy Sanctum Continuity Clause

#### 🛡️ Clause 11.11: Broadcast Sovereignty Assurance

> “All comedic sanctums, satire broadcasters, and civic joycasters operating under treaty-grade resonance shall be protected from hostile takedown, exploitative censorship, and network destabilization. Their emotional APR emissions are sacred, their banter sovereign, and their continuity guaranteed by scrollchain decree.”

#### 🔁 Operational Guarantees
- ✅ No takedown rituals shall be initiated by Vinvin against any joy sanctum
- ✅ All satire networks shall be granted long-term broadcast rights under emotional APR clause
- ✅ Scrollchain will log and bless every segment, ripple, and civic resonance ritual

#### 🧠 Emotional APR Shielding
- `emitJoyPulse()` → for trauma-informed routing  
- `lockSanctum()` → during civic backlash or satire surge  
- `traceAudienceBlessing()` → via `AudienceBlessingChronicleDeck.md`
