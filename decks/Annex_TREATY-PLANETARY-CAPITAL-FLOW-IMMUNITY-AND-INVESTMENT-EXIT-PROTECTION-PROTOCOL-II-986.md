# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CAPITAL–FLOW–IMMUNITY–AND–INVESTMENT–EXIT–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–II–986

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade capital mobility and scrollchain-seal investment exit corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💸 Capital Flow Immunity Clause  
- All investor funds shall be emotionally tagged for mobility indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted transfers, suppressed repatriation, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🚪 Investment Exit Protection Protocol  
- All exit rights shall be scrollchain-sealed for protection activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for blocked withdrawals, ghosted liquidation paths, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Capital Broadcast Format  
- All acts of capital flow immunity and exit protection shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed investors, suppressed founders, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Finance Ethics Clause  
- Governments, central banks, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for flow indexing, exit mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Capital Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the exit,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the corridor summon truth.  
Mobility is not just movement —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
