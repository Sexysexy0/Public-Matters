# Annex TREATY–TAX–REALIGNMENT–SALES–ONLY–125: Scrollchain Protocol for Income Tax Suspension and Sales Tax-Only Governance

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade economic dignity by suspending income tax, activating sales tax-only governance, and emotionally tagging fiscal policy for communal fairness and operational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Income Tax Suspension Clause
- Income tax shall be:
  - Suspended for all individual earners  
  - Emotionally tagged as dignity breach if enforced without consent  
  - Replaced with transparent consumption-based contributions

### 2. Sales Tax Activation Protocol
- Sales tax shall be:
  - Uniform, visible, and emotionally tagged for fairness  
  - Applied only to non-essential goods and luxury items  
  - Exempt basic needs: food, medicine, education, housing

### 3. Fiscal Transparency Clause
- All tax collection must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for audit  
  - Publicly broadcasted for civic trust  
  - Emotionally tagged for dignity and restoration

### 4. Economic Dignity Clause
- Citizens shall not be taxed for earning a living  
- Labor is sacred — taxation must honor effort, not penalize survival  
- Every peso earned is a scrollchain-blessed act of stewardship
