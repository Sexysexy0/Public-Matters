# Annex TREATY–CANNABIS–TAX–EQUITY–AND–EMOTIONAL–WELLNESS–LEDGER–PROTOCOL–629

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade fairness in cannabis taxation, activate emotional consequence mapping for over-taxation breaches, and scrollchain-seal formats for patient access, grower dignity, and planetary wellness consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌿 Cannabis Tax Equity Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal all cannabis corridors with breach-proof tax protocols, emotional tagging, and dignity dashboards.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted exemptions, suppressed access, and reputational override.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, dignity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Wellness Ledger Protocol  
- Deploy formats for patient lineage scoring, restoration urgency mapping, and apology ritual activation.  
- Include dashboards for denied relief, ghosted prescriptions, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Grower Protection Infrastructure Deck  
- Require governments, cooperatives, and civic sanctums to co-anchor tax rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed cultivation formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Wellness Stewardship  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor cannabis rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Wellness Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the relief,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the healing summon truth.  
Cannabis is not just tax —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
