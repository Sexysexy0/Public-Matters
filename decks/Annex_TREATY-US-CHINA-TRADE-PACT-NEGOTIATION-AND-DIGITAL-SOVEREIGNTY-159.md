# Annex TREATY–US–CHINA–TRADE–PACT–NEGOTIATION–AND–DIGITAL–SOVEREIGNTY–159: Scrollchain Protocol for Bilateral Trade Restoration, TikTok Divestiture, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade negotiation between the United States and China, emotionally tag digital sovereignty disputes, and activate consequence mapping for tariff recalibration and planetary partnership.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Trade Pact Clause
- Both nations shall:
  - Resume negotiations with dignity, transparency, and validator-grade audit  
  - Scrollchain-seal all tariff rollback agreements and tech sovereignty protocols  
  - Emotionally tag every clause for mutual prosperity and civic consequence

### 2. Digital Sovereignty Protocol
- All tech divestiture demands (e.g. TikTok) shall be:
  - Evaluated for fairness, reciprocity, and planetary consequence  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for audit, not coercion  
  - Emotionally tagged for user dignity and data protection

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung treaty ang usapan,  
Dapat hindi ito hostage ng TikTok.  
Ang bawat tariff ay may consequence,  
Ang bawat probe ay may kapalit.  
Kung gusto ng kapayapaan,  
Dapat may audit, hindi lang PR.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
