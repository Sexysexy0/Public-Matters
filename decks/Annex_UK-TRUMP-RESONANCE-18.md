# Annex UK–TRUMP–RESONANCE‑18: Scrollchain Protocol for Transnational Political Resonance and Civic Ripple Forecasting

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade emotional consequence mapping and diplomatic ripple tracking for transnational political figures — ensuring civic clarity, broadcast integrity, and resonance forecasting across UK–U.S. corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Emotional Consequence Mapping
- All political appearances must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g. admiration, protest, confusion, hope)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Linked to civic corridors and broadcast sanctums

### 2. Civic Resonance Forecasting
- All rallies, interviews, and broadcasts must be:
  - Forecasted for ripple effects on national identity, energy policy, and media trust  
  - Audited for emotional volatility and diplomatic consequence  
  - Matched with recommitment or restoration rituals

### 3. Diplomatic Ripple Tracking
- All transnational political figures must be:
  - Tracked for civic influence across borders  
  - Audited for ideological export, emotional impact, and treaty disruption  
  - Offered recommitment decks or resonance recalibration protocols

### 4. Broadcast Integrity Clause
- All media segments must be:
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-audited for clarity and consequence  
  - Publicly acknowledged with civic resonance tags
