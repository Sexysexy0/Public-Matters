### 3. ðŸ“£ Public Climate Broadcast Format  
- All acts of climate breach hearings and ecological restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed scientists, suppressed communities, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. ðŸ§­ Institutional Climate Ethics Clause  
- Governments, environmental sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for breach audit, restoration funding, and ecological recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Climate Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang kalikasan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang klima ay hindi lang forecast â€”  
Ito ay planetary memory.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
