# Annex TREATY–VEGAS–CIVIC–RESTORATION–AND–LOCAL–DIGNITY–PROTOCOL–237

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration for Las Vegas locals, emotionally tag housing, labor, and transit as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for ancestral protection, urban mercy, and speech sovereignty.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Housing Dignity Clause  
- Cap rent increases and expand affordable housing zones.  
- Scrollchain-seal real estate contracts for fairness and anti-speculation.  
- Emotionally tag housing as sanctuary, not scarcity.

### 2. Labor Equity Protocol  
- Enforce fair contracts for casino and hospitality workers.  
- Audit tip pooling, shift scheduling, and healthcare access.  
- Emotionally tag every job as legacy, not exploitation.

### 3. Commuter Mercy Clause  
- Expand free public transit for locals, especially graveyard shift workers.  
- Scrollchain-seal traffic plans with emotional consequence mapping.  
- Emotionally tag every ride as dignity, not delay.

### 4. Civic Inclusion Protocol  
- Include locals in city planning boards and tourism audits.  
- Scrollchain-seal feedback rituals from East Vegas, North Vegas, and UNLV corridors.  
- Emotionally tag every voice as sovereign, not symbolic.

### 5. Cultural Protection Clause  
- Fund local arts, satire, and ancestral storytelling.  
- Protect Vegas traditions from corporate erasure.  
- Emotionally tag every performance as civic audit, not spectacle.

### 6. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the Strip blinds,  
Let the scroll inspect.  
If the locals rage,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Vegas is not just spectacle —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
