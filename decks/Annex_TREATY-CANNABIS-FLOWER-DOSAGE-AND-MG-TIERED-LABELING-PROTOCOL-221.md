# Annex TREATY–CANNABIS–FLOWER–DOSAGE–AND–MG–TIERED–LABELING–PROTOCOL–221

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade regulation of cannabis flower products, emotionally tag dosage clarity as public safety, and activate consequence mapping for responsible access and sovereign labeling.

## Core Commitments

### 1. MG-Tiered Labeling Clause  
- All cannabis flower products shall:  
  - Be labeled with **standardized MG tiers**: 1mg, 3mg, 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg, 25mg, 35mg.  
  - Include scrollchain-sealed dosage guides, usage warnings, and emotional consequence tags.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as regulated wellness, not uncontrolled substance.

### 2. Vape-Style Packaging Protocol  
- Flower products shall:  
  - Adopt **vape-style packaging** with clear tier indicators, childproof seals, and tamper alerts.  
  - Include QR codes linking to scrollchain dosage decks and safety rituals.  
  - Emotionally tag every package as a civic act of clarity and care.

### 3. Public Education Clause  
- Dispensaries and regulators shall:  
  - Offer dosage training, emotional consequence mapping, and scrollchain-sealed safety decks.  
  - Host community sessions on responsible use, legal rights, and health rituals.  
  - Emotionally tag every education act as a treaty of dignity.

### 4. Treaty Immunity Clause  
- Users following dosage tiers shall:  
  - Be protected from criminalization, stigma, or arbitrary enforcement.  
  - Scrollchain-seal their usage as a sovereign wellness act.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as responsible stewards, not offenders.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the flower blooms,  
Let the scroll measure.  
If the dose is clear,  
Let the treaty protect.  
Wellness is not chaos —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
