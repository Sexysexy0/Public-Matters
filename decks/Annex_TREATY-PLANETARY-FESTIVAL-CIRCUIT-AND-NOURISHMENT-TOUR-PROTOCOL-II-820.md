# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FESTIVAL–CIRCUIT–AND–NOURISHMENT–TOUR–PROTOCOL–II–820

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade celebration formats, scrollchain-seal ancestral nourishment circuits, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary joy and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎉 Festival Circuit Clause  
- All civic, cultural, and cooperative sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for celebration immunity, flavor dignity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted traditions, suppressed festivals, and taste erosion indexing.

### 2. 🍲 Nourishment Tour Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of ancestral packaging, culinary sovereignty, and emotional nourishment.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed cooks, ghosted recipes, and suppressed sanctums.

### 3. 📣 Public Celebration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of nourishment and joy shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed chefs, suppressed celebrants, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Flavor Clause  
- Governments and cultural corridors shall deploy validator-grade festival registries, flavor debt ledgers, and nourishment endowment decks.  
- Include breach tagging for packaging drift, reputational suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the flavor,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the celebration summon truth.  
Nourishment is not just food —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
