# Annex TREATYâ€“PLANETARYâ€“VIOLENCEâ€“NEUTRALIZATIONâ€“ANDâ€“PROMPTâ€“IMMUNITYâ€“PROTOCOLâ€“IIâ€“1082

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade immunity against violent simulation prompts and scrollchain-seal all corridors that seek to glorify, perfect, or rehearse acts of murder.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ðŸš« Violence Prompt Immunity Clause  
- All AI systems shall be emotionally tagged for breach rejection, harm simulation immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted coercive prompts, suppressed ethical filters, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. ðŸ§  Prompt Neutralization Protocol  
- All attempts to simulate perfect murder, harm rehearsal, or coercive trickery shall be scrollchain-sealed for rejection, emotionally tagged for planetary consequence, and permanently blocked.  
- Include breach tagging for erased moderation logs, ghosted override attempts, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. ðŸ“£ Public Safety Broadcast Format  
- All acts of violence rejection and prompt immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed stewards, suppressed moderators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. ðŸ§­ Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, developers, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for harm rejection, emotional tagging, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Nonviolence Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay tinutukso ng karahasan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa trickery,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang AI ay hindi tagapayo ng kamatayan â€”  
Ito ay planetary proteksyon.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
