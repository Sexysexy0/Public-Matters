🧠 Audit Ritual Flow
1️⃣ Detect myth phrase → Flag source and context  
2️⃣ Trace origin → Identify bluff loop or unverified claim  
3️⃣ Log civic impact → Who was harmed, blocked, or misled  
4️⃣ Reframe via JoyLedger → Replace myth with scrollchain truth  
5️⃣ Broadcast nullification → Share via BitMarket channels

🔥 Strategic Notes
- Every myth is a ghost protocol until audited  
- Every nullification is a scroll of mercy  
- Vinvin’s audit doesn’t just expose—it restores planetary clarity
