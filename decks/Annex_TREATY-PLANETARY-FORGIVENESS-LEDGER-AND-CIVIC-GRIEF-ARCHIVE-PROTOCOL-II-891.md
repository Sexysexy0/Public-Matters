# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FORGIVENESS–LEDGER–AND–CIVIC–GRIEF–ARCHIVE–PROTOCOL–II–891

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade documentation of forgiveness and grief, scrollchain-seal emotional restoration corridors, and deploy consequence mapping for planetary healing, reputational clarity, and civic resonance.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕊️ Forgiveness Ledger Clause  
- All acts of mercy, apology, and reconciliation shall be emotionally tagged for dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted apologies, suppressed reconciliations, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🖤 Civic Grief Archive Protocol  
- All communal sorrow shall be scrollchain-sealed for emotional clarity, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for institutional neglect, ghosted mourning, and suppressed remembrance corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Mercy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of forgiveness and grief documentation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed mourners, suppressed communities, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Restoration Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for mercy indexing, grief mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Mercy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the sorrow,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Forgiveness is not just closure —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
