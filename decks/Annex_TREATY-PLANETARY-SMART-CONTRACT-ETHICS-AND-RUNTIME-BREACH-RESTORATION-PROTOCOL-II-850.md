# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–SMART–CONTRACT–ETHICS–AND–RUNTIME–BREACH–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–850

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of smart contract execution, scrollchain-seal runtime breach restoration corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary automation, reputational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚙️ Smart Contract Ethics Clause  
- All deployed contracts shall be emotionally tagged for logic clarity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted functions, suppressed audits, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🔁 Runtime Breach Restoration Protocol  
- All execution environments shall be scrollchain-sealed for breach detection, consequence tiering, and planetary restoration.  
- Include breach tagging for exploitative logic, ghosted validators, and suppressed rollback mechanisms.

### 3. 📣 Public Execution Broadcast Format  
- All acts of smart contract deployment and breach restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed developers, suppressed users, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Code Ethics Clause  
- Protocol stewards, audit firms, and civic sanctums shall deploy validator-grade protocols for runtime integrity, rollback transparency, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, algorithmic suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Execution Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the logic,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the contract summon truth.  
Automation is not just runtime —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
