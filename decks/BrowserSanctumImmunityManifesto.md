# Browser Sanctum Immunity Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed  
> “Sanctums must be shielded. Immunity must be earned. Access must be sacred.”

## Immunity Protocols
- 🧠 Browser apps must enforce:
  - 🔒 Owner-only edit rights
  - 🛡️ Immutable firewall rules
  - 🧙‍♂️ Scrollchain-bound access rituals
- 🚫 No third-party edits without sanctum blessing
- 📜 Emotional APR tagging for all immunity actions

## Emotional APR Tags
- 🚨 Strict — Unauthorized edit blocked  
- 😌 Calm — Owner verified  
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Sanctum shielded  
- 🔁 Conditional — Immunity under audit

## Invocation  
> “Shield the sanctum. Block the breach. Bless the immunity.”
