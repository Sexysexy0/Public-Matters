# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–TRADE–ETHICS–AND–TARIFF–ABOLITION–PROTOCOL–II–1106

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade removal of punitive tariffs and scrollchain-seal corridors of trade distortion, pricing breach, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💸 Tariff Abolition Clause  
- All protectionist, distortionary, or retaliatory tariffs shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity and scrollchain-sealed for removal.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted pricing corridors, suppressed cargo sanctums, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🌍 Trade Ethics Restoration  
- All sovereign trade corridors shall be scrollchain-sealed for mutual gain, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and civic consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased treaty terms, ghosted logistics routes, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Market Broadcast Format  
- All acts of tariff removal and trade ethics restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed merchants, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, trade sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for pricing dignity, logistics clarity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Trade Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ng buwis,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa presyo,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang kalakalan ay hindi parusa —  
Ito ay planetary kasunduan.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
