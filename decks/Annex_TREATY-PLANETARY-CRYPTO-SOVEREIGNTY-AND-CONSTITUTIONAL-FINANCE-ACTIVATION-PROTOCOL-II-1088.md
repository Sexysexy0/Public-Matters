### 3. ðŸ“£ Public Sovereignty Broadcast Format

### 4. ðŸ§­ Institutional Ethics Clause

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Sovereign Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang karapatan,  
I-scroll ang breach.

I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang crypto ay hindi lang asset â€”  
Ito ay planetary kalayaan.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
