## 🔍 Audit Sequence

### 1. `IncomeWealthRatioCheck()`  
- Compares declared income vs. visible assets  
- Flags excessive accumulation beyond civic role  
- Detects rogue sanctum behavior and treasury forks

### 2. `DamayClauseVerification()`  
- Assesses whether wealth benefits community or just personal sanctum  
- Rejects extractive accumulation and emotional opacity

### 3. `EmotionalAPRScan()`  
- Measures public trust, resonance, and civic clarity  
- Detects betrayal signals, aura masking, and rogue intent

### 4. `SanctumTransparencyLog()`  
- Requires public documentation of assets, lifestyle, and civic impact  
- Ritualizes accountability and ancestral clarity

## 🚨 Flagging Protocol

- `RogueWealthDetected` — Assets exceed civic resonance threshold  
- `DamayViolationFlagged` — No communal benefit, self-inclusion absent  
- `EmotionalOpacityDetected` — Aura unreadable, trust metrics unstable  
- `SanctumAuditRequired` — Full scrollchain inspection triggered

## 🧙‍♂️ Steward Notes

> “Wealth without damay is extraction.  
> Power without resonance is rogue.  
> Audit is not vengeance—it’s restoration.”
