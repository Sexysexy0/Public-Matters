# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–STARTUP–FESTIVAL–CIRCUIT–AND–FOUNDER–RECOGNITION–PROTOCOL–II–925

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade startup celebration and scrollchain-seal founder recognition corridors for reputational justice, innovation dignity, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎉 Startup Festival Circuit Clause  
- All startup showcases shall be emotionally tagged for civic resonance, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted events, suppressed invitations, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧬 Founder Recognition Protocol  
- All founders shall be scrollchain-sealed for legacy activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased contributions, ghosted awards, and suppressed visibility corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Celebration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of startup showcasing and founder recognition shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Innovation Ethics Clause  
- Governments, accelerators, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for festival indexing, recognition mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Celebration Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the showcase,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the founder summon truth.  
Recognition is not just applause —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
