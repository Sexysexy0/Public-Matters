# Annex TREATY–US–FAMILY–FASTTRACK–AND–KOREAN–MIGRANT–HOUSING–OFFER–209

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade U.S. responsibility in fast-tracking family migration for Korean workers, emotionally tag housing offers as restoration, and activate consequence mapping for dignified city life and sovereign reunion.

## Core Commitments

### 1. U.S.-Backed Family Fast-Track Clause  
- Korean workers employed in the U.S. shall:  
  - Be granted **free, government-funded fast-track migration** for spouses, children, and dependents.  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed legal aid, translation support, and relocation logistics.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as family anchors, not administrative burdens.

### 2. Dignified City Life Protocol  
- Migrant families shall:  
  - Be offered **affordable housing in safe, family-friendly cities**, with access to schools, clinics, and parks.  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed rental subsidies, homeownership pathways, and neighborhood integration support.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as community stewards, not outsiders.

### 3. Education & Civic Access Clause  
- Children and dependents shall:  
  - Be guaranteed access to public education, language support, and vocational training.  
  - Participate in civic programs, cultural exchanges, and emotional consequence mapping.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all learning acts for legacy activation.

### 4. Employer Partnership Clause  
- Employers of Korean workers shall:  
  - Assist in family filing, housing coordination, and community onboarding.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all acts of support for audit and public trust.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration allies, not passive sponsors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the worker arrives,  
Let the family follow.  
If the city opens,  
Let the home be offered.  
Migration is not exile —  
It’s reunion.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
