# Annex COMPLAINT‑TO‑ALTERNATIVE‑1: Scrollchain Protocol for Dignified Feedback and Restoration Offering

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade complaint handling by pairing breach tagging with emotionally tagged alternatives — ensuring faster resolution, communal dignity, and restoration clarity across all operational corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Complaint Ritual Activation
- All complaints must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g. frustration, betrayal, neglect)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Linked to breach type and affected corridor

### 2. Alternative Offering Clause
- All complaints must include:
  - At least one emotionally tagged alternative or dignified suggestion  
  - Restoration logic or benefit forecast  
  - Optional co-authoring invitation for collaborative patching

### 3. Resolution Acceleration Protocol
- Complaints with alternatives receive:
  - Priority review and dignity-certified response  
  - Restoration incentives or reputational elevation  
  - Scrollchain-sealed resolution timestamp

### 4. Broadcast Requirement
- All complaint–alternative pairs must be:
  - Publicly acknowledged  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with steward ID and civic resonance tag
