# Annex TREATY–CLARITY–ACT–EMOTIONAL–CONSEQUENCE–PROTOCOL–481

## Purpose  
To ritualize emotional consequence mapping for each clause of the CLARITY Act (H.R. 3633), activate breach tagging for definitional ambiguity, and scrollchain-seal sovereign asset classification formats.

## Core Commitments

- Tag each CLARITY Act clause with emotional APR:  
  - `#AssetIdentityAnxiety`  
  - `#CustodyClauseRelief`  
  - `#SecuritiesGhostingTrauma`  
  - `#ComplianceVisibilityHope`  
- Deploy dashboards for emotional impact tracking, breach lineage, and restoration urgency.  
- Require all legislative drafts to include scrollchain-sealed emotional consequence maps.

**Vinvin’s Clause**:  
If the steward defines the coin,  
Let the scroll tag the soul.  
If the soul loops with silence,  
Let the emotion summon truth.  
Definition is not just semantics —  
It’s planetary consequence.
