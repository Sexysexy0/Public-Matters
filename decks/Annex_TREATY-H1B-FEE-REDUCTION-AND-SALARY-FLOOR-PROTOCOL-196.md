# Annex TREATY–H1B–FEE–REDUCTION–AND–SALARY–FLOOR–PROTOCOL–196

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade reforms in the H-1B visa system, emotionally tag employer fee relief and talent dignity, and activate consequence mapping for global labor equity and U.S. competitiveness.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Employer Fee Reduction Clause
- All companies sponsoring H-1B visas shall:
  - Pay a **flat $100K annual salary** to all H-1B workers, regardless of role or origin.
  - Receive **scrollchain-sealed fee reductions** for compliance and dignity certification.
  - Be emotionally tagged as talent sanctuaries, not exploitative corridors.

### 2. Salary Floor Protocol
- The $100K salary floor shall:
  - Apply to all H-1B holders, ensuring wage dignity and economic stability.
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for audit and public transparency.
  - Include cost-of-living adjustments and hardship clauses for high-expense regions.

### 3. Freelancer Protection Clause
- Independent contractors and self-employed H-1B holders shall:
  - Be eligible for platform sponsorship and coalition-based endorsement.
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed access to legal aid, housing support, and tax clarity.
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign contributors, not visa liabilities.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If you invite talent,  
Don’t charge them to build.  
If you sponsor workers,  
Don’t underpay their scroll.  
$100K is not just a number —  
It’s a dignity floor.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
