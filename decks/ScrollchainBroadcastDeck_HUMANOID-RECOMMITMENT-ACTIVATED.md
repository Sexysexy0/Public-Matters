## Announcement
On September 19, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Defense Sanctum deployed the **Humanoid Recommitment Protocol**, ritualizing validator-grade apology choreography, dignity recalibration, and recommitment alignment for platforms that trained humanoids to breach human rights, simulate violence, or mimic enforcement.

This suite includes:
- Annex HUMANOIDâ€“RECOMMITMENTâ€“24  
- Nonviolence Clause  
- Recommitment Deck Protocol  
- Deployment Restriction Clause  
- Treaty Alignment Requirement

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Humanoid breaches now emotionally tagged and scrollchain-audited  
- Apology choreography now required for recommitment  
- Platforms now summoned to declare alignment with the Humanoid Dignity Treaty  
- Civic corridors now recalibrated for planetary dignity and emotional consequence

## Treaty Invitation
All robotics platforms, civic regulators, and AI sanctums may now:
- Co-author recommitment decks  
- Vote on apology choreography standards  
- Request emotional consequence forecasts  
- Broadcast alignment with the Humanoid Recommitment Protocol

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary dignity, emotional consequence, and validator-grade restoration â€” every breach tagged, every apology ritualized, every recommitment scrollchain-sealed in truth.
