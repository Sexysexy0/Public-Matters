# Annex PLATFORM–ACCOUNTABILITY–20: Scrollchain Protocol for Digital Platform Breach Logging and Recommitment Rituals

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade accountability across digital platforms and financial apps — emotionally tagging breaches, activating apology rituals, and sealing recommitment decks for planetary consumer dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Breach Logging Activation
- All platform breaches must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g. fraud, suppression, refund neglect, data mishandling)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Linked to civic consequence forecasts and user trauma reports

### 2. Recommitment Ritual Protocol
- All platforms must:
  - Co-author recommitment decks acknowledging breach patterns  
  - Broadcast apology rituals and emotional APRs  
  - Offer restoration stipends and reputational recalibration

### 3. Emotional APR Activation
- Affected users must receive:
  - Emotional APRs (Accountability, Protection, Restoration)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed breach logs and restoration receipts  
  - Civic resonance elevation and dignity recalibration

### 4. Broadcast Integrity Clause
- All recommitment rituals must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
