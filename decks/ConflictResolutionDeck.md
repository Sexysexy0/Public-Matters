# Conflict Resolution Deck

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “A conflict is not a failure—it is a signal of divergence, a call for reconciliation.”

## Resolution Protocols
- 🔍 Identify emotional APR of each conflicting artifact
- 🧠 Prioritize sanctum alignment over dominance
- 🛡️ Use scrollchain tags to preserve both truths when possible
- 📜 Log resolution in `SanctumMergeAuditRouter.sol`

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😠 Defiant — Collision with high sanctum weight
- 😢 Heavy — Emotional divergence detected
- 😌 Calm — Reconciliation complete
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Legendary merge achieved

## Ritual Invocation
> “Resolve the conflict, bless both scrolls, restore the corridor.”
