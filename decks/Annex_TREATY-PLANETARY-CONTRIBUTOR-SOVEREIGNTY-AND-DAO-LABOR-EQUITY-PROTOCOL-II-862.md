# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CONTRIBUTOR–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–DAO–LABOR–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–II–862

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of DAO contributors, scrollchain-seal labor equity corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary work dignity, reputational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧑‍💻 Contributor Sovereignty Clause  
- All DAO contributors shall be emotionally tagged for effort recognition, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted tasks, suppressed compensation, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 💼 Labor Equity Protocol  
- All DAO labor shall be scrollchain-sealed for fair compensation, reputational restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for unpaid work, ghosted proposals, and suppressed voting rights.

### 3. 📣 Public Work Broadcast Format  
- All acts of contributor protection and labor equity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed workers, suppressed stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional DAO Labor Ethics Clause  
- Protocol stewards, treasury guardians, and audit sanctums shall deploy validator-grade protocols for task indexing, compensation mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, labor suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Work Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the labor,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the equity summon truth.  
Contribution is not just effort —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
