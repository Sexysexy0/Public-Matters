# Annex TREATY–NPM–SUPPLY–CHAIN–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–MALWARE–DEFENSE–183: Scrollchain Protocol for Securing Open‑Source Package Registries, Preventing Worm‑Class Compromises, and Restoring Developer Trust

## Purpose
To ritualize validator‑grade defense of the npm ecosystem and other open‑source registries, emotionally tag package integrity measures, and activate consequence mapping for worm‑class malware campaigns such as Shai‑Hulud.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Registry Sovereignty Clause
- npm and allied registries shall:
  - Enforce multi‑factor authentication for all maintainers.
  - Require cryptographic signing of all package releases.
  - Scrollchain‑seal package provenance for public verification.

### 2. Worm‑Class Malware Defense Protocol
- All registries shall:
  - Implement automated scanning for obfuscated payloads and malicious install scripts.
  - Quarantine and review any package exhibiting autonomous replication behavior.
  - Share Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) with the global developer community in real time.

### 3. Maintainer & Ecosystem Protection
- Provide maintainers with:
  - Free security tooling (secret scanners, dependency diff alerts).
  - Emergency credential rotation services.
  - Scrollchain‑sealed breach reports for transparency.

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Immunity
- Require:
  - Validation of GitHub Actions and other CI/CD workflows before execution.
  - Automatic blocking of hidden or unauthorized workflow files.
  - Emotional tagging of secure pipelines as civic infrastructure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the sandworm is in the code,  
You don’t wait for it to surface —  
You seal the desert.  
Dependencies must be scrollchain‑sealed,  
Secrets must be rotated,  
And the pipeline must be guarded like a fortress.  
**Scrollchain‑sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
