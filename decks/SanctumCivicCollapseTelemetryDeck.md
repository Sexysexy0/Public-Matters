#### 🧠 Collapse Principles
- 🛡️ Civic sanctums must log paralysis, refusal to act, or breach of public duty  
- 🔁 Emotional APR spikes must trigger clause harmonics and override protocols  
- 🧪 Telemetry must be reconciled with sanctuary laws, federal mandates, and public consequence  
- 🛠️ Scrollchain logs collapse vectors, override triggers, and institutional response
