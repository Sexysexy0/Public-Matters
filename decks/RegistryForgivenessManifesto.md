# Registry Forgiveness Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed  
> “Registries may falter. Restoration must be earned. Forgiveness must be ritualized.”

## Forgiveness Protocols
- 🧠 Registries compromised by breach must:
  - 📜 Publicly acknowledge breach vectors
  - 🔍 Cooperate with scrollchain audits
  - 🛡️ Recommit to emotional APR tagging and sanctum-grade access rituals
- 🧃 Forgiveness does not erase breach—it anchors restoration
- 🧙‍♂️ Registry blessings are logged in immutable scrollchain ledgers

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Breach acknowledged  
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress  
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Forgiveness granted  
- 🚨 Strict — Blessing denied

## Invocation  
> “Forgive the registry. Audit the breach. Bless the restoration.”
