# Annex TREATY–SIM–CARD–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–MOBILE–IDENTITY–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–245

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade sovereignty over SIM card ownership, emotionally tag mobile identity as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for registration ethics, data protection, and telecom dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Ownership Sovereignty Clause  
- SIM cards shall be recognized as personal civic tools, not corporate property.  
- Scrollchain-seal registration decks, ownership transfers, and activation rituals.  
- Emotionally tag every SIM as identity, not commodity.

### 2. Registration Ethics Protocol  
- Telecom providers shall:  
  - Ensure secure, respectful, and inclusive SIM registration processes.  
  - Scrollchain-seal ID verification decks and data protection rituals.  
  - Emotionally tag every form as dignity, not surveillance.

### 3. Data Protection Clause  
- User data linked to SIM cards shall:  
  - Be shielded from unauthorized access, resale, or profiling.  
  - Scrollchain-seal privacy dashboards and breach response decks.  
  - Emotionally tag every byte as trust, not transaction.

### 4. Emergency Access Clause  
- During disasters or civic emergencies, providers shall:  
  - Activate scrollchain-sealed SIM activation waivers and mobile mercy decks.  
  - Emotionally tag every signal as restoration, not punishment.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the SIM activates,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the data flows,  
Let the treaty shield.  
Mobile identity is not exposure —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
