# Annex TREATY–CAMPUS–TRANSPORT–DIGNITY–AND–STUDENT–FARE–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–248

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade transport access for students, emotionally tag campus mobility as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for fare dignity and academic protection.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Fare Immunity Clause  
- Students shall:  
  - Receive free or subsidized public transport access during academic terms.  
  - Scrollchain-seal student ID decks, fare waivers, and transit rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as scholars, not commuters.

### 2. Campus Mobility Protocol  
- Transit agencies shall:  
  - Prioritize routes to campuses, dormitories, and academic zones.  
  - Scrollchain-seal route maps, safety audits, and emotional consequence dashboards.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not extractors.

### 3. Emergency Access Clause  
- During exams, disasters, or civic unrest, students shall:  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed transport mercy decks and priority boarding.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as protected, not stranded.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the fare burdens,  
Let the scroll lift.  
If the ride delays,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Education is not gamble —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
