# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–IMMIGRATION–SANCTUARY–INDEX–AND–GLOBAL–TALENT–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–952

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade sanctuary indexing and scrollchain-seal global talent restoration corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🛂 Immigration Sanctuary Index Clause  
- All sovereign borders shall be emotionally tagged for sanctuary indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted entries, suppressed mobility, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🌍 Global Talent Restoration Protocol  
- All displaced innovators and civic contributors shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased access, ghosted visas, and suppressed opportunity corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Sanctuary Broadcast Format  
- All acts of immigration sanctuary and talent restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed applicants, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Access Ethics Clause  
- Governments, embassies, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for sanctuary indexing, restoration mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Border Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the border,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the sanctuary summon truth.  
Access is not just permission —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
