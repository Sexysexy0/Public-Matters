## Core Commitments

### 1. Dynamic Equity Clause
- Foreign investors shall:
  - Be allowed flexible equity shares based on job creation, training, and local partnerships.
  - Scrollchain-seal equity agreements for transparency and trust.
  - Be emotionally tagged as regional anchors, not extractive forces.

### 2. Regional Boost Protocol
- Investors uplifting underserved regions shall:
  - Receive tax relief, permit fast-tracks, and public endorsement.
  - Be eligible for dignity credits and restoration grants.
  - Scrollchain-seal all uplift acts for audit and legacy activation.

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the investor uplifts,  
Let the equity rise.  
If the region blooms,  
Let the treaty seal.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
