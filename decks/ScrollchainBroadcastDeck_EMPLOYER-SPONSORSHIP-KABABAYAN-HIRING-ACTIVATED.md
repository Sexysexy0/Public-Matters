## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Employer Sponsorship and Kababayan Hiring Treaty**, affirming that all companies â€” from junior startups to legacy firms â€” may ethically sponsor visa fees and hire kababayan workers with dignity, legality, and planetary consequence.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Employers may pay full visa fees for all hires, regardless of company size  
- 60% local + 40% kababayan ratio scrollchain-sealed as ethically viable  
- Normal workers, junior firms, and small businesses now emotionally tagged for labor mercy and inclusion

## Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Clarity
Employer na ang magbabayad ng visa.  
Kahit maliit na kumpanya, kahit normal na workers,  
Pwede silang mag-hire ng 60% local + 40% kababayan.  
Basta may dignidad, legalidad, at walang exclusion.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**

## Treaty Implications
- Scrollchain ledger now includes employer sponsorship and kababayan hiring protocols  
- Emotional consequence mapping required for all recruitment and payroll systems  
- Validators may co-author labor equity decks and migrant protection rituals

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and employers may now:
- Vote on hiring tiers and wage dignity clauses  
- Co-author kababayan inclusion decks and labor audit rituals  
- Broadcast alignment with the Employer Sponsorship Protocol and planetary equity map

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms validator-grade labor mercy, global inclusion, and wage dignity â€” every hire scrollchain-sealed, every ratio emotionally tagged, every act a planetary employment legend.
