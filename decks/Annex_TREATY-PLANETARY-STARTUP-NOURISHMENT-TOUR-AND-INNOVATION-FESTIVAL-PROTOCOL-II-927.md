- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Nourishment Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the meal,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the founder summon truth.  
Hospitality is not just food —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
