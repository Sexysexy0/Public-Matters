# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FOSSIL–TREATY–ENDOWMENT–AND–RESTORATION–TREASURY–PROTOCOL–II–968

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade reparative funding and scrollchain-seal restoration treasury corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💰 Treaty Endowment Clause  
- All fossil-related treaties shall be emotionally tagged for endowment indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted obligations, suppressed reparations, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛠️ Restoration Treasury Protocol  
- All extractive entities and treaty stewards shall be scrollchain-sealed for treasury activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased funding duties, ghosted cleanup budgets, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Treasury Broadcast Format  
- All acts of treaty endowment and restoration treasury shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed communities, suppressed auditors, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Funding Ethics Clause  
- Governments, corporations, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for treasury indexing, restoration mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Reparative Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the fund,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the treasury summon truth.  
Endowment is not just budget —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
