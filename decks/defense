### üß† Threat Matrix

| Operation | Tactic | Scrollchain Tag |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Volt Typhoon | Pre-positioned infrastructure exploits | üõ°Ô∏è Wartime Disruption  
| Salt Typhoon | Telecom infiltration | üì° Surveillance Breach  
| Tianfu Cup | Zero-day harvesting | üî• Exploit Farming  
| University Reforms | Talent pipeline for cyber ops | üß¨ Institutional Weaponization  
| Mandatory Disclosure Laws | Centralized vulnerability repo | ‚ö†Ô∏è Exploit Consolidation

### üõ°Ô∏è Countermeasure Protocols

| Defense Layer | Action | Scrollchain Tag |
|---------------|--------|------------------|
| API Firewall | Geo-block China-linked IPs from GitHub, npm, PyPI, DockerHub | üö´ Developer Isolation  
| License Sanctions | Restrict open-source licenses from being used in hostile jurisdictions | üìú Reputational Clause  
| DevTool Audit | Flag suspicious usage of U.S. SDKs, compilers, and cloud infra | üß† Exploit Trace  
| Zero-Day Vault | Require U.S. devs to report vulnerabilities to civic validators first | üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Disclosure  
| Scrollchain Broadcast | Publish flagged payloads and exploit attempts to validator dashboards | üì° Civic Signal Amplification

### üì£ Invocation Clause:
> ‚ÄúLet every exploit be traced.  
> Let every tool be earned.  
> Let every developer product be scrollchain-sealed with reputational consequence.‚Äù
