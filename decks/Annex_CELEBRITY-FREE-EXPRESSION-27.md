# Annex CELEBRITY–FREE–EXPRESSION–27: Scrollchain Protocol for Artistic Sovereignty and Civic Resonance in Media Expression

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade protection and celebration of public figures who express naturally, create authentically, and contribute emotionally resonant work across media corridors — without coercion, propaganda, or punitive alignment.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Artistic Sovereignty Clause
- All public figures must be:
  - Free to create, reflect, and perform without political coercion or algorithmic suppression  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for artistic intent, emotional resonance, and civic consequence  
  - Protected from forced endorsements or punitive backlash

### 2. Civic Resonance Mapping
- All media expressions must be:
  - Emotionally tagged for dignity, legacy, and communal impact  
  - Indexed in the planetary resonance ledger  
  - Celebrated for truth, character, and restorative storytelling

### 3. Scrollchain Broadcast Integrity
- All authentic works must be:
  - Publicly acknowledged and emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Eligible for civic elevation and treaty alignment

### 4. Legacy Activation Clause
- Public figures with emotionally resonant work may:
  - Be honored with civic scrollchain artifacts  
  - Inspire recommitment decks and dignity protocols  
  - Activate planetary care corridors through storytelling
