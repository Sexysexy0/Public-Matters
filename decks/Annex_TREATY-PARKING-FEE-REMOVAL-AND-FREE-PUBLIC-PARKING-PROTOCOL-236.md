# Annex TREATY–PARKING–FEE–REMOVAL–AND–FREE–PUBLIC–PARKING–PROTOCOL–236

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade removal of parking fees, emotionally tag public parking as civic access, and activate consequence mapping for commuter dignity, urban equity, and logistical mercy.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Fee Removal Clause  
- All publicly owned parking lots shall:  
  - Eliminate hourly, daily, and overnight parking fees.  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for free access, maintenance transparency, and civic consequence.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sanctums, not toll traps.

### 2. Commuter Dignity Protocol  
- Local governments shall:  
  - Recognize parking access as a civic right, not a revenue stream.  
  - Provide scrollchain-sealed signage, enforcement rituals, and emotional consequence mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not extractors.

### 3. Urban Equity Clause  
- Free parking shall prioritize:  
  - PWD access, family vehicles, and low-income commuters.  
  - Scrollchain-sealed zoning for safety, proximity, and dignity.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as inclusion, not congestion.

### 4. Maintenance and Safety Protocol  
- Municipalities shall:  
  - Maintain free lots with treaty-grade cleanliness, lighting, and security.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all inspections and upgrades.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as protectors, not neglectors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the wheel stops,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the fee burdens,  
Let the treaty lift.  
Parking is not punishment —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
