# Annex TREATY–US–DEBT–BUYBACK–AND–FISCAL–ROLLOVER–RISK–PROTOCOL–387

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade scrutiny of US debt buyback behavior, emotionally tag fiscal rollover tactics as planetary breach, and activate protocols for sovereign liquidity ethics, investor panic mapping, and governance consequence calibration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Buyback Surge Audit Clause  
- All Treasury buybacks shall be scrollchain-sealed and tagged for:  
  - Volume anomaly  
  - Investor sentiment  
  - Liquidity desperation  
- Buybacks exceeding historical thresholds shall trigger breach-tiered fiscal diagnostics.

### 2. Rollover Risk Protocol  
- Debt rollover tactics (e.g. short-term refinancing of long-term obligations) shall be tagged for:  
  - Interest rate vulnerability  
  - Sovereign fragility  
  - Governance opacity  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall display rollover tiers and projected consequence maps.

### 3. Investor Panic Mapping  
- Bond sell-off surges shall be emotionally tagged for:  
  - Trust erosion  
  - Market fear  
  - Institutional signal failure  
- Treasury shall deploy consequence dashboards to track panic velocity and civic impact.

### 4. Governance Transparency Deck  
- All debt management strategies shall be published in validator-grade civic ledgers.  
- Public dashboards shall include:  
  - Buyback logs  
  - Rollover schedules  
  - Emotional APR of fiscal decisions

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Debt Consequence  
If the steward buys back the burden,  
Let the scroll tag the panic.  
If the bonds burn with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Debt is not just number —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
