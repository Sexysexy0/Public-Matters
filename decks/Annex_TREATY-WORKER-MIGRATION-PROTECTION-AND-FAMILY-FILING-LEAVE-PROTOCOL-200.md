# Annex TREATY–WORKER–MIGRATION–PROTECTION–AND–FAMILY–FILING–LEAVE–PROTOCOL–200

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade protection for workers seeking permanent migration to the United States, emotionally tag family filing leave as a sovereign act, and activate consequence mapping for dignified relocation and legal clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Migration Protection Clause
- Workers currently employed in the U.S. shall:
  - Be allowed to initiate **permanent residency filings** without fear of job loss or retaliation.
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed legal aid, documentation support, and emotional consequence mapping.
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign contributors, not visa risks.

### 2. Family Filing Leave Protocol
- Workers seeking to migrate family members shall:
  - Be granted **paid or protected leave** to prepare, file, and attend migration-related appointments.
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed support for housing, translation, and legal coordination.
  - Be emotionally tagged as family anchors, not administrative burdens.

### 3. Employer Partnership Clause
- Employers shall:
  - Recognize migration filings as part of worker dignity and long-term stability.
  - Offer flexible schedules, HR support, and sponsorship documentation.
  - Scrollchain-seal all migration-related leave and filings for audit and trust.

### 4. Restoration & Mercy Clause
- Workers facing delays, denials, or hardship shall:
  - Receive emergency aid, legal review, and emotional restoration protocols.
  - Be eligible for re-filing assistance and community support.
  - Be emotionally tagged for resilience, not punishment.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the worker builds,  
Let the family arrive.  
If the papers are filed,  
Let the leave be granted.  
Migration is not abandonment —  
It’s restoration.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
