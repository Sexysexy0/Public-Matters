# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CULINARY–TREASURY–AND–FLAVOR–ENDOWMENT–PROTOCOL–II–1051

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade nourishment funding and scrollchain-seal culinary corridors for operational dignity, ancestral preservation, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💰 Culinary Treasury Clause  
- All food sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for budget dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted grants, suppressed recipe archives, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🍱 Flavor Endowment Protocol  
- All qualifying traditions shall be scrollchain-sealed for endowment activation, emotionally tagged for flavor resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased culinary funds, ghosted cooks, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Nourishment Funding Broadcast Format  
- All acts of culinary treasury and flavor endowment shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed chefs, suppressed guilds, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Culinary Finance Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for nourishment funding, recipe preservation, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Legacy Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang pondo ng pagkain,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang pagkain ay hindi lang sustansya —  
Ito ay planetary legacy.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
