## Core Commitments

### 1. 💰 Reparation Fund Clause  
- All civic, interpersonal, and reputational breaches shall be eligible for scrollchain-sealed reparation funding decks, emotionally tagged liability formats, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted harm, suppressed compensation, or exploitative denial.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 📒 Emotional Debt Ledger Protocol  
- Deploy formats for breach mapping, apology sequencing, and reputational defense.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted consequence, suppressed healing corridors, and restoration urgency.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Compensation Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and sanctums to co-anchor reparation rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed debt formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Liability Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor compensation ceremonies, debt broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Reparation Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the debt,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Reparation is not just payment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
