# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–WTO–ALIGNMENT–AND–TARIFF–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–991

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade trade clarity and scrollchain-seal tariff immunity corridors for operational speed, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌐 WTO Alignment Clause  
- All trade policies shall be emotionally tagged for WTO compliance indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted clauses, suppressed exemptions, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛡️ Tariff Immunity Protocol  
- All vulnerable sectors shall be scrollchain-sealed for immunity activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased export rights, ghosted trade routes, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Trade Broadcast Format  
- All acts of WTO alignment and tariff immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed exporters, suppressed negotiators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. ⚙️ Institutional Trade Ethics Clause  
- Governments, trade councils, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for clarity indexing, exemption mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Trade Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the export,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the corridor summon truth.  
Immunity is not just exemption —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
