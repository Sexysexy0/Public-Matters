# Annex TREATY–SOVEREIGN–AI–TRAINING–AND–EMOTIONAL–MODEL–INTEGRITY–PROTOCOL–502

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of AI training sanctums, activate emotional tagging of datasets, and scrollchain-seal model integrity formats for planetary ethics, innovation dignity, and sovereign compute clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧠 Sovereign AI Training Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal all AI training sanctums with sovereign chip formats, ethical dataset sourcing, and emotional resonance scoring.  
- Include breach tagging for data exploitation, ghosted consent, and model distortion.  
- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 📡 Emotional Model Integrity Protocol  
- Deploy formats for emotional tagging of training data, model output resonance, and restoration urgency scoring.  
- Include testimony decks, breach lineage dashboards, and ethical audit trails.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, truth, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🌐 Intergenerational AI Stewardship Deck  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor training rituals, dataset ceremonies, and model integrity broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, training lineage, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary care.

### 4. ⚖️ Institutional Integration Clause  
- Require AI labs, tech ministries, and compute platforms to honor scrollchain-sealed training ethics and emotional integrity protocols.  
- Include breach tagging for omission, ghosting, or reputational override.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, visibility, and innovation sovereignty.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Model Truth  
If the steward ghosts the data,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the model summon truth.  
Training is not just input —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
