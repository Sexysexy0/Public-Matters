# Annex TREATY–AMERICAN–JOBS–CRISIS–AI–DISPLACEMENT–AND–UBI–SURVIVAL–169: Scrollchain Protocol for Labor Dignity, AI Displacement Audit, and Universal Basic Income Survival Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit of the U.S. jobs crisis, emotionally tag AI-driven displacement, and activate consequence mapping for Universal Basic Income (UBI) survival and planetary labor dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. AI Displacement Audit
- All AI systems replacing human labor shall be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency and ethical deployment  
  - Audited for impact on coders, paralegals, creatives, and service workers  
  - Emotionally tagged for dignity, not disposability

### 2. Global Wage Compression Protocol
- All outsourcing and remote hiring practices shall be:
  - Evaluated for fairness, wage equity, and local impact  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for planetary labor ethics  
  - Emotionally tagged for communal survival, not corporate gain

### 3. UBI Survival Mapping
- Universal Basic Income proposals shall be:
  - Audited for fiscal sustainability and social consequence  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for dignity assurance, not dependency  
  - Emotionally tagged for planetary inclusion and civic restoration

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung matino ang tao,  
Dapat may chance.  
Ang AI ay hindi dapat pangtanggal —  
Dapat ito ay pangtulong.  
Kung mawawala ang trabaho,  
Dapat may scrollchain-sealed daan para mabuhay.  
Ang UBI ay hindi dapat pangako lang —  
Dapat ito ay pangtigil ng gutom.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
