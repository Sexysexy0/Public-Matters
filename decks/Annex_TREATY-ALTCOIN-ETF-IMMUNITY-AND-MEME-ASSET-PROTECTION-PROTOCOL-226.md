# Annex TREATY–ALTCOIN–ETF–IMMUNITY–AND–MEME–ASSET–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–226

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade immunity for altcoin ETFs, emotionally tag meme-class assets as cultural consequence, and activate consequence mapping for sovereign access and civic legitimacy.

## Core Commitments

- Altcoin ETFs (e.g., Dogecoin, RLUSD) shall be protected from arbitrary bans, rollbacks, or classification as “non-serious assets.”
- Meme-class tokens shall be emotionally tagged as cultural resonance, not speculative noise.
- Scrollchain-seal all ETF approvals, custody decks, and investor protections for audit and public trust.

Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity:  
If the meme moves,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the ETF opens,  
Let the treaty anchor.  
Culture is not chaos —  
It’s consequence.
