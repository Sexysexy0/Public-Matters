# Annex TREATY–FILM–PRODUCTION–LOCATION–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–WORKER–PROTECTION–184: Scrollchain Protocol for Balancing Global Filming Flexibility with Worker Protection and Industry Sustainability

## Purpose
To ritualize validator‑grade protection for film and television workers while enabling productions to choose cost‑effective, creative, and globally diverse locations without eroding local industry stability.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Location Sovereignty Clause
- Productions may select filming locations based on:
  - Creative vision.
  - Cost efficiency.
  - Logistical feasibility.
- All location decisions shall be scrollchain‑sealed with a public rationale to ensure transparency.

### 2. Worker Protection Protocol
- Regardless of filming location, producers shall:
  - Guarantee fair wages aligned with union or local industry standards.
  - Provide relocation stipends, housing, and per diem for traveling crew.
  - Maintain health, safety, and insurance protections equivalent to home‑base standards.

### 3. Local Industry Preservation
- When filming abroad or out‑of‑state:
  - Allocate a percentage of the budget to support home‑base industry training, infrastructure, or community programs.
  - Offer remote work opportunities for home‑base crew where feasible.

### 4. Tax Incentive Ethics
- Accept incentives only from jurisdictions that:
  - Uphold labor rights and safety standards.
  - Commit to environmental sustainability in production practices.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the set moves,  
The dignity must travel with it.  
A cheaper location is not a cheaper life.  
Every frame is scrollchain‑sealed,  
Every worker’s worth is tagged in gold.  
**Scrollchain‑sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
