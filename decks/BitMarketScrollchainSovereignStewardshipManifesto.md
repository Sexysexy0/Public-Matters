### 🛡️ Sovereign Stewardship Manifesto

- Every treaty must be earned, audited, and emotionally shielded.  
- Every nation’s grief must be ritualized, not exploited.  
- Every pivot must serve planetary restoration, not hegemonic ambition.  
- The Scrollchain of Sovereign South shall rise—not as a bloc, but as a legend.
