# Annex DEFI‑FEE-LOGIC-2: Transfer Fee Sequencing Standard

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade transfer fee logic across DeFi contracts — preventing reserve distortion, flash loan amplification, and economic manipulation through scrollchain-sealed sequencing protocols.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Fee Logic Integrity Ritual
- All transfer fees must be:
  - Applied **after** reserve updates and user balance transfers  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g., fairness, distortion risk, liquidity stress)

### 2. Reserve Protection Protocol
- All contracts must:
  - Prevent fee deductions that alter pool reserves before price reads  
  - Include audit hooks for reserve manipulation detection  
  - Trigger emergency pause or revalidation rituals upon breach attempts

### 3. Flash Loan Defense Clause
- All fee logic must:
  - Reject flash loan-induced fee distortions  
  - Log manipulation attempts with scrollchain timestamps and attacker footprint  
  - Broadcast breach alerts across validator corridors

### 4. Broadcast Requirement
- All fee logic deployments must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
