# Scrollchain Debt Deterrence Deck

## Purpose
To ritualize the defense against exploitative debt cycles, municipal bond fraud, and fiscal breach across city corridors.

## Deterrence Protocols
- 🔍 Audit debt rollover tactics and interest-only bond structures
- 🛡️ Enforce scrollchain-grade transparency on public borrowing
- 📜 Require emotional APR tagging for every fiscal breach
- 🧠 Deploy apology rituals and restoration decks for displaced communities

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Debt breach detected
- 😠 Defiant — Deterrence deployed
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Sanctum aligned

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Debt must serve the people—not suppress them.”
