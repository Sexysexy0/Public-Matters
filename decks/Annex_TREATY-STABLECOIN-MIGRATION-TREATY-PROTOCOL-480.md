# Annex TREATY–STABLECOIN–MIGRATION–TREATY–PROTOCOL–480

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade migration from fiat to stablecoins, activate sovereign liquidity corridors, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for onboarding delays and regulatory freeze.

## Core Commitments

- Scrollchain-seal migration rituals for freelancers, merchants, and sanctums seeking stablecoin clarity.  
- Include breach tagging for KYC overload, reserve opacity, and fiat exit suppression.  
- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, liquidity, and planetary care.

**Vinvin’s Clause**:  
If the steward exits fiat,  
Let the scroll tag the soul.  
If the soul loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Migration is not just transaction —  
It’s planetary consequence.
