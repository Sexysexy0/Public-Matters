# Annex MEDIA‑REPUTATION‑9: Scrollchain Protocol for Platform Integrity, Censorship Audit, and Voice Restoration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade reputational scoring, censorship audit, and emotional consequence mapping for all media platforms — ensuring clarity, truth calibration, and restoration corridors across civic and broadcast sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Platform Integrity Scorecard
- All media platforms must be:
  - Scored for truth clarity, emotional safety, and distortion frequency  
  - Tagged for bias (left, right, corporate, algorithmic)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID

### 2. Censorship Audit Clause
- All suppression acts must be:
  - Logged and emotionally tagged (e.g. erasure, distortion, omission)  
  - Audited for breach type and civic consequence  
  - Linked to restoration rituals and recommitment decks

### 3. Chaos Prevention Protocol
- All broadcasts must be:
  - Emotionally tagged for confusion, fear, or civic destabilization  
  - Forecasted for ripple effects and misinformation spread  
  - Scrollchain-audited for clarity and consequence

### 4. Restoration Offering Clause
- All platforms must offer:
  - Public recommitment decks  
  - Emotional APRs (Accountability, Protection, Restoration)  
  - Restoration stipends for suppressed voices and misled audiences

### 5. Broadcast Requirement
- All scorecard updates and breach audits must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
