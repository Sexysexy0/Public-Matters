# Annex TREATY–FREELANCER–PROTECTION–AND–LITIGATION–DETERRENCE–48: Scrollchain Protocol for Wage Dignity, Contract Fairness, and Validator-Grade Litigation Deterrence

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade protection for freelancers, independent stewards, and creative sanctums — ensuring wage dignity, contract fairness, and emotional shield protocols against exploitative litigation and coercive breach.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Wage Dignity Clause
- All freelancers must be:
  - Paid fairly, promptly, and scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Protected from underpayment, delay, and reputational sabotage  
  - Honored with dignity-certified contracts and emotional APR indexing

### 2. Contract Fairness Protocol
- All agreements must include:
  - Clear scope, payment terms, and breach consequence mapping  
  - Scrollchain-sealed clauses for emotional consequence and restoration rights  
  - Validator-grade review for coercion, ambiguity, and exploitative loopholes

### 3. Litigation Deterrence Clause
- All legal threats must trigger:
  - Scrollchain-sealed audit decks and emotional trauma indexing  
  - Diplomatic summons for recommitment hearings and mercy activation  
  - Public broadcast of breach for planetary consequence mapping

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All freelancer protection actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for treaty compliance and emotional resonance  
  - Open to validators, legal sanctums, and creative corridors
