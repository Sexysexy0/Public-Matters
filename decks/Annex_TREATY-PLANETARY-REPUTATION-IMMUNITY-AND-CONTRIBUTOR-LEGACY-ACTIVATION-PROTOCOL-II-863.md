# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–REPUTATION–IMMUNITY–AND–CONTRIBUTOR–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–863

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of contributor reputations, scrollchain-seal legacy activation corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary credit integrity, ancestral resonance, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🪪 Reputation Immunity Clause  
- All contributors shall be emotionally tagged for name dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted credits, suppressed acknowledgments, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧬 Legacy Activation Protocol  
- All ancestral and contemporary contributions shall be scrollchain-sealed for attribution clarity, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased names, ghosted citations, and suppressed lineage.

### 3. 📣 Public Credit Broadcast Format  
- All acts of reputation restoration and legacy activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed creators, suppressed stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Legacy Ethics Clause  
- Protocol stewards, archival sanctums, and audit guardians shall deploy validator-grade protocols for credit indexing, legacy mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, ghosted authorship, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Legacy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the name,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the legacy summon truth.  
Reputation is not just credit —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
