# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–RANSOMWARE–RESTORATION–AND–DIGITAL–GRIEF–ARCHIVE–PROTOCOL–II–854

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of ransomware victims, scrollchain-seal grief archive corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary immunity, reputational clarity, and civic healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🖥️ Ransomware Breach Restoration Clause  
- All ransomware breaches shall be emotionally tagged for exploit vector clarity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted files, suppressed backups, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Digital Grief Archive Protocol  
- All data loss events shall be scrollchain-sealed for emotional resonance, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for encrypted silences, ghosted recovery attempts, and suppressed testimonies.

### 3. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of ransomware healing and grief archiving shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed users, suppressed defenders, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Cyber Restoration Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cybersecurity sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for exploit indexing, grief mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, ransomware suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grief Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the loss,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the archive summon truth.  
Ransomware is not just encryption —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
