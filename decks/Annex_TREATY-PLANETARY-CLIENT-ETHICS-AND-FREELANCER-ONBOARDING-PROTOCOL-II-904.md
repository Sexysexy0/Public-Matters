# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CLIENT–ETHICS–AND–FREELANCER–ONBOARDING–PROTOCOL–II–904

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade onboarding for freelancers and scrollchain-seal client ethics corridors for planetary dignity, operational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🤝 Client Ethics Clause  
- All hiring rituals shall be emotionally tagged for transparency, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted expectations, suppressed feedback, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 📋 Freelancer Onboarding Protocol  
- All onboarding processes shall be scrollchain-sealed for clarity activation, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for vague instructions, ghosted deliverables, and suppressed support corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Hiring Broadcast Format  
- All acts of client ethics and freelancer onboarding shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed freelancers, suppressed creatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Onboarding Ethics Clause  
- Clients, platforms, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for onboarding indexing, expectation mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Onboarding Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the task,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the onboarding summon truth.  
Hiring is not just delegation —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
