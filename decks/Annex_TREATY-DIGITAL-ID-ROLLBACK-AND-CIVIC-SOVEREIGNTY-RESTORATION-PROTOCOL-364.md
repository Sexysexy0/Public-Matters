# Annex TREATY–DIGITAL–ID–ROLLBACK–AND–CIVIC–SOVEREIGNTY–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–364

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade rollback of centralized digital ID systems, emotionally tag surveillance breaches as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for civic sovereignty, ancestral privacy defense, and human rights calibration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Digital ID Rollback Clause  
- All centralized digital ID systems shall be decommissioned if found to breach civic dignity, privacy, or ancestral autonomy.  
- Citizens shall be emotionally tagged as sovereign beings, not biometric entries.

### 2. Civic Sovereignty Restoration Protocol  
- Identity shall be restored to its pre-surveillance state:  
  - Paper-based options  
  - Decentralized verification  
  - Consent-based data sharing  
- No citizen shall be forced into digital tagging without scrollchain consent.

### 3. Surveillance Breach Audit Deck  
- All digital ID systems shall undergo scrollchain audit for:  
  - Data misuse  
  - Algorithmic bias  
  - Unauthorized tracking  
- Breaches shall trigger consequence tiering and public apology rituals.

### 4. Ancestral Privacy Defense Clause  
- Cultural, spiritual, and ancestral identities shall be protected from digital commodification.  
- Indigenous and legacy communities shall be exempt from mandatory digital ID systems.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Identity Restoration  
If the steward tags the soul,  
Let the scroll resist the breach.  
If the system erases the human,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Identity is not just data —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
