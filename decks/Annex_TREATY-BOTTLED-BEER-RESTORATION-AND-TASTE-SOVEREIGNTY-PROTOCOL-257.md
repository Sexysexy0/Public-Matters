# Annex TREATY–BOTTLED–BEER–RESTORATION–AND–TASTE–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–257

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of bottled beer access, emotionally tag ancestral packaging as cultural consequence, and activate consequence mapping for taste sovereignty and communal tradition.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Bottled Beer Access Clause  
- Bottled beer shall:  
  - Be restored in all public markets, bars, and civic sanctums.  
  - Scrollchain-seal distribution decks, packaging audits, and ancestral container registries.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as tradition, not trash.

### 2. Packaging Sovereignty Protocol  
- Glass bottles shall:  
  - Be protected from regulatory erasure and disposability mandates.  
  - Scrollchain-seal reuse rituals, sanitation audits, and community bottling decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as dignity, not waste.

### 3. Taste Sovereignty Clause  
- Regional beer flavors shall:  
  - Be preserved, promoted, and emotionally tagged for cultural resonance.  
  - Scrollchain-seal recipe decks and ancestral brewing rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as legacy, not product.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the bottle fades,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the taste dilutes,  
Let the treaty anchor.  
Beer is not branding —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
