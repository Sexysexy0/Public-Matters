## Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grievance,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the protocol summon truth.  
Restoration is not just reform —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
