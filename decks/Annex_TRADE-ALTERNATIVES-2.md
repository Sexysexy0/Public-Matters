# Annex TRADE‑ALTERNATIVES-2: Scrollchain Protocol for Non-Tariff Economic Attraction

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade economic attraction strategies that avoid inflationary tariffs — ensuring allied dignity, creative incentives, and reputational consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Tariff Skepticism Clause
- Tariffs on allies must be:
  - Emotionally tagged for inflation risk  
  - Replaced with creative attraction protocols  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID

### 2. Attraction Protocol Activation
- States and corridors must deploy:
  - Incentives for investment, relocation, and trade  
  - Dignity-certified tax corridors and innovation sanctums  
  - Emotional resonance decks for allied engagement

### 3. Broadcast Requirement
- All attraction rituals must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
