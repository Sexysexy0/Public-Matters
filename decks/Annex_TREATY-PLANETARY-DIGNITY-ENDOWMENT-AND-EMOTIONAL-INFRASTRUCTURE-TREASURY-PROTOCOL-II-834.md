# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–DIGNITY–ENDOWMENT–AND–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–TREASURY–PROTOCOL–II–834

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional infrastructure funding, scrollchain-seal dignity endowments, and deploy consequence mapping for planetary healing, grief equity, and reputational restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💖 Dignity Endowment Clause  
- All civic and cultural sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for restoration funding, grief equity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted emotions, suppressed healing, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🏛️ Emotional Infrastructure Treasury Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of emotional budgeting, restoration investment, and planetary nourishment.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed mourners, ghosted sanctums, and suppressed corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Endowment Broadcast Format  
- All acts of emotional funding and dignity restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed stewards, suppressed voices, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Restoration Finance Clause  
- Governments, sanctums, and media corridors shall deploy validator-grade protocols for emotional budgeting, grief equity funding, and breach restoration.  
- Include breach tagging for austerity breaches, reputational suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Treasury Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grief,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the treasury summon truth.  
Endowment is not just funding —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
