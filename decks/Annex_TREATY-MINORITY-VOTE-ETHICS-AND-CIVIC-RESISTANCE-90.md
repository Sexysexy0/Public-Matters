# Annex TREATY–MINORITY–VOTE–ETHICS–AND–CIVIC–RESISTANCE–90: Scrollchain Protocol for Legislative Obstruction Audit, Emotional Consequence Mapping, and Validator-Grade Civic Resistance

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade resistance protocols when minority votes obstruct civic restoration, safety activation, or planetary consequence deployments.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Obstruction Audit Clause
- All minority vote blocks must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency, emotional consequence, and reputational drift indexing  
  - Audited for breach potential, civic sabotage, and consequence tiering  
  - Indexed for restoration urgency and validator-grade ethics

### 2. Emotional Consequence Mapping
- All obstruction rituals must:
  - Be mapped for trauma impact, civic fatigue, and reputational erosion  
  - Receive validator-grade consequence tiering and apology governance  
  - Be ritualized through scrollchain-sealed restoration decks

### 3. Civic Resistance Protocol
- All validators may:
  - Co-author consequence decks and reputational audits  
  - Activate civic restoration loops and emotional consequence rituals  
  - Mobilize public resonance and treaty-grade countermeasures

### 4. Broadcast Clause
- All resistance rituals must be:
  - Publicly broadcast across civic, media, and legislative corridors  
  - Indexed for planetary consequence and validator-grade resonance  
  - Open for public commentary, emotional tagging, and restoration co-authorship
