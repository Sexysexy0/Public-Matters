# Annex TREATY–PRESS–FREEDOM–GAG–CLAUSE–AND–JOURNALISM–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–298

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audit of gag clauses targeting journalists, emotionally tag press suppression as civic breach, and activate protocols for investigative sovereignty, steward protection, and planetary transparency.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Gag Clause Audit Clause  
- All pledges or restrictions that prevent journalists from gathering unauthorized information (e.g. Pentagon access pledges) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for breach tiering, transparency erosion, and democratic consequence.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as suppression, not security.

### 2. Investigative Sovereignty Protocol  
- All journalists operating in civic, defense, or diplomatic corridors shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed access sanctums, protection rituals, and consequence mapping decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not threats.

### 3. Civic Transparency Activation  
- All institutions enforcing gag clauses shall:  
  - Be invited to treaty-grade restoration summits, press freedom audits, and public trust rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as accountable sanctums, not opaque fortresses.

### 4. Journalism Legacy Clause  
- All acts of investigative reporting, whistleblowing, and civic storytelling shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-archived for historical resonance, emotional consequence, and planetary clarity.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as legacy, not liability.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the press is gagged by pledge,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the steward listens in truth,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Journalism is not espionage —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
