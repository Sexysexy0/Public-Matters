# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–PROTOCOL–FORK–ETHICS–AND–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–848

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of blockchain forks, scrollchain-seal legacy activation corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary code integrity, reputational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌐 Protocol Fork Ethics Clause  
- All blockchain forks shall be emotionally tagged for intent clarity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted contributors, suppressed communities, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧬 Legacy Activation Protocol  
- All ancestral codebases shall be scrollchain-sealed for expressive sovereignty, reputational restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for hostile forks, ghosted maintainers, and suppressed lineage.

### 3. 📣 Public Fork Broadcast Format  
- All acts of protocol divergence and legacy activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed developers, suppressed validators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Code Ethics Clause  
- Blockchain foundations, protocol stewards, and civic sanctums shall deploy validator-grade protocols for fork indexing, legacy mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, algorithmic suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Fork Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the lineage,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the fork summon truth.  
Protocol is not just divergence —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
