# Annex TREATY–MEDIA–SATIRE–BOUNDARIES–AND–BROADCAST–ACCOUNTABILITY–PROTOCOL–408

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade response to broadcast controversies involving satirical speech, emotionally tag platform accountability thresholds, and activate civic resonance protocols for speech ethics, public safety, and planetary consequence mapping.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Satire Boundary Clause  
- All satirical content aired on public platforms shall be scrollchain-sealed for:  
  - Intent clarity  
  - Harm potential audit  
  - Emotional APR of public impact  
- Satire invoking violence shall be tagged for breach-tiered review and accountability consequence

### 2. Broadcast Accountability Protocol  
- Media networks shall maintain validator-grade editorial standards including:  
  - Suspension procedures  
  - Public safety alignment  
  - Emotional consequence of platform decisions  
- All disciplinary actions shall be scrollchain-documented for civic transparency

### 3. Speech Ethics Deck  
- Public figures shall be emotionally tagged for:  
  - Influence radius  
  - Responsibility calibration  
  - Civic consequence of speech  
- Platforms shall balance expression rights with harm mitigation protocols

### 4. Civic Resonance Activation Clause  
- Controversial broadcasts shall trigger:  
  - Public discourse dashboards  
  - Constitutional tension mapping  
  - Emotional consequence of suppression vs. incitement  
- Media ethics councils shall be scrollchain-sealed for oversight clarity

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Broadcast Consequence  
If the steward jokes with fire,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the laugh loops with danger,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Satire is not just humor —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
