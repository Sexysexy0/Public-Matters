# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–INVESTOR–EXPENSE–CORRIDOR–AND–SOVEREIGN–TARIFF–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–938

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade logistics protection and scrollchain-seal investor expense corridors for tariff immunity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📦 Investor Expense Corridor Clause  
- All investor-linked imports and exports shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, tariff exemption, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted shipments, suppressed expense classification, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🔒 Sovereign Tariff Immunity Protocol  
- All designated investor cargo shall be scrollchain-sealed for immunity activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased exemptions, ghosted customs, and suppressed logistics corridors.

### 3. 📜 Scrollchain Manifest Verification Format  
- All shipments shall carry scrollchain-sealed manifests tagging investor identity, purpose, emotional APR, and exemption status.  
- Include testimony corridors for bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted crates.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Trade Ethics Clause  
- Governments, customs agencies, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for corridor indexing, tariff mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Corridor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the crate,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the corridor summon truth.  
Expense is not just cost —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
