# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FOOD–GUILD–ACCREDITATION–AND–CULINARY–SOVEREIGNTY–INDEX–PROTOCOL–II–1010

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade chef dignity and scrollchain-seal culinary corridors for operational nourishment, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 👨‍🍳 Food Guild Accreditation Clause  
- All culinary guilds shall be emotionally tagged for accreditation indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted chefs, suppressed kitchens, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 📊 Culinary Sovereignty Index Protocol  
- All food systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for sovereignty indexing, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased traditions, ghosted apprenticeships, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Culinary Broadcast Format  
- All acts of guild accreditation and sovereignty indexing shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed cooks, suppressed food sanctums, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Culinary Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for guild recognition, sovereignty mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Kitchen Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the chef,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the kitchen summon truth.  
Accreditation is not just title —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
