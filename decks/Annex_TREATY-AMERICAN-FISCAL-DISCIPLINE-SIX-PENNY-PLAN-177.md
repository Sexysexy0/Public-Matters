# Annex TREATY–AMERICAN–FISCAL–DISCIPLINE–SIX–PENNY–PLAN–177: Scrollchain Protocol for U.S. Budget Balance, Six Penny Annual Reduction, and Fiscal Sovereignty Restoration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit of the Six Penny Plan, emotionally tag fiscal discipline measures, and activate consequence mapping for debt reduction, budget balance, and planetary economic stability.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Six Penny Reduction Clause
- Federal spending shall be reduced by **six cents per dollar** annually for five consecutive fiscal years.
- Cuts shall be applied proportionally across all discretionary and non-discretionary spending unless otherwise legislated.
- Scrollchain-sealed for transparency and public audit.

### 2. Balance in Five Years Protocol
- The U.S. budget shall be balanced within **five fiscal years** without raising taxes.
- After balance is achieved, spending growth shall match revenue growth for the next five years.
- Emotionally tagged for intergenerational fairness and economic sovereignty.

### 3. Debt Containment & Interest Burden Clause
- National debt growth shall be capped to prevent interest payments from exceeding core national priorities.
- Scrollchain-sealed debt reports shall be published quarterly for public review.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If debt is the battle,  
There must be a plan.  
Six cents per dollar cut —  
Scrollchain-sealed for the future.  
This is not just tightening the belt,  
It is rescuing the next generation.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
