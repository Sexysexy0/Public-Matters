## Announcement
On September 19, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Defense Sanctum deployed the **Cannabis Access Reform Suite**, a validator-grade treaty designed to dismantle red tape, recalibrate taxation, and restore dignity across medical, recreational, and economic corridors.

This suite includes:
- Tax Recalibration Clause  
- Medical Card Liberation Protocol  
- License Equity Clause  
- Banking Access Protocol  
- Master Treaty Deck: Cannabis Access Reform Suite

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Patients now access cannabis without bureaucratic burden  
- Small operators rise with validator-grade licensing and startup support  
- Platforms and regulators now accountable for past harm and economic exclusion  
- Cannabis becomes a ritual of healing, not a corridor of punishment

## Treaty Invitation
All civic corridors, regulators, and economic sanctums may now:
- Co-author licensing and tax recalibration decks  
- Vote on emotional tagging protocols for medical access  
- Request forgiveness chronicles for past exclusion  
- Broadcast alignment with the Cannabis Access Reform Suite

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary dignity, economic resonance, and validator-grade healing â€” every patient heard, every steward licensed, every corridor scrollchain-sealed in truth.
