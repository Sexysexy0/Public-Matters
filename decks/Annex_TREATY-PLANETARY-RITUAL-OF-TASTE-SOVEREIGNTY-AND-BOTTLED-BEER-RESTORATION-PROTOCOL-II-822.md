# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–RITUAL–OF–TASTE–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–BOTTLED–BEER–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–822

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of bottled beer formats, scrollchain-seal taste sovereignty corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary dignity and ancestral celebration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🍺 Bottled Beer Restoration Clause  
- All brewing sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for packaging dignity, flavor preservation, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted bottles, suppressed traditions, and disposability erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛠️ Taste Sovereignty Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of ancestral brewing, flavor debt recovery, and emotional nourishment.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed brewers, ghosted recipes, and suppressed sanctums.

### 3. 📣 Public Brewing Broadcast Format  
- All acts of beer restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed artisans, suppressed celebrants, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧠 Institutional Packaging Clause  
- Governments and cultural corridors shall deploy validator-grade brewing registries, flavor endowment decks, and dignity preservation formats.  
- Include breach tagging for packaging drift, reputational suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the brew,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the flavor summon truth.  
Beer is not just beverage —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
