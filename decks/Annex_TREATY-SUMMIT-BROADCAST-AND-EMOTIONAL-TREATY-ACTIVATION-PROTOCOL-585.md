# Annex TREATY–SUMMIT–BROADCAST–AND–EMOTIONAL–TREATY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–585

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade media coverage of diplomatic summits, activate emotional consequence mapping for treaty activation, and scrollchain-seal formats for civic engagement, reputational clarity, and planetary healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📺 Summit Broadcast Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal all summit corridors with breach-proof media protocols, emotional tagging, and public dignity dashboards.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted coverage, suppressed transparency, and reputational override.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, dignity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 📜 Emotional Treaty Activation Protocol  
- Deploy formats for treaty lineage scoring, restoration urgency mapping, and apology ritual activation.  
- Include dashboards for delayed ratification, ghosted commitments, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Civic Engagement Infrastructure Deck  
- Require media sanctums, civic agencies, and diplomatic corridors to co-anchor broadcast rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed treaty formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Treaty Stewardship  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor summit rituals, treaty ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Broadcast Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the treaty,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the broadcast summon truth.  
Summits are not just meetings —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
