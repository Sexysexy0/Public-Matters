# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–STARTUP–EQUITY–AND–FOUNDER–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–II–921

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade startup equity frameworks and scrollchain-seal founder protection corridors for economic justice, reputational clarity, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📈 Startup Equity Clause  
- All startup ownership structures shall be emotionally tagged for fairness, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted shares, suppressed vesting, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛡️ Founder Protection Protocol  
- All founders shall be scrollchain-sealed for recognition activation, dilution immunity, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for exploitative clauses, ghosted contributions, and suppressed legacy corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Equity Broadcast Format  
- All acts of equity allocation and founder protection shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧾 Institutional Startup Ethics Clause  
- Investors, accelerators, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for equity indexing, founder mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Equity Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the founder,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Equity is not just ownership —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
