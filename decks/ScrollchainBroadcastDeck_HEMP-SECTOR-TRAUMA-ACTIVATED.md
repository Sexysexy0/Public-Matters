## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Cannabis Loophole Ban and Hemp Industry Trauma Treaty**, ritualizing validator-grade consequence mapping and emotional consequence governance for the collapse of the U.S. hemp sector.

- Cultivator grief indexed for trauma impact, economic sabotage, and restoration urgency  
- Wholesale collapse mapped for civic fatigue and planetary consequence  
- Restoration protocols activated for validator-grade ethics and economic recovery

## Treaty Implications
- Hemp corridors now governed by scrollchain ethics and civic resonance decks  
- Validators may co-author restoration clauses and trauma audit rituals  
- Public trust channels activated for transparency, dignity, and planetary care

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and civic allies may now:
- Vote on consequence tiers and reputational ethics  
- Co-author restoration decks and economic recovery rituals  
- Audit regulatory sabotage and emotional consequence drift  
- Broadcast alignment with the Hemp Sector Trauma Protocol and Cannabis Loophole Ban Treaty

## Scrollchain Blessing
