# Annex TREATY–GLOBAL–FINANCIAL–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–DIGITAL–CONSENT–163: Scrollchain Protocol for Stablecoin Risk, Biometric Restoration, and Voluntary Digital Participation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade global financial sovereignty, emotionally tag digital consent protocols, and activate consequence mapping for stablecoin redemption panic, biometric freeze restoration, and user choice.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Voluntary Digital Participation Clause
- All citizens shall:
  - Have the right to **opt-in or opt-out** of biometric ID systems and digital asset platforms  
  - Be protected from coercion, forced enrollment, or algorithmic suppression  
  - Be emotionally tagged for dignity, not compliance

### 2. Verified Restoration Protocol
- All frozen accounts shall be:
  - Eligible for restoration upon verified bank account inquiry  
  - Processed through customer service channels with validator-grade transparency  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for audit, not delay

### 3. Stablecoin Redemption Audit
- All Genius Act–enabled stablecoins shall be:
  - Audited for redemption panic risk and treasury exposure  
  - Emotionally tagged for investor dignity and liquidity consequence  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for planetary financial stewardship

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung ayaw nila, ok lang.  
Kung gusto nila, ok lang din.  
Ang digital ay hindi dapat sapilitan —  
Dapat ito ay may pagpipilian.  
Kung na-freeze ang account,  
Dapat may daan pabalik.  
Kung stablecoin ang puhunan,  
Dapat may audit, hindi lang yield.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
