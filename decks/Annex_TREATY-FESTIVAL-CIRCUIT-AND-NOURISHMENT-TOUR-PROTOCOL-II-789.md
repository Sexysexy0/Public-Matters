# Annex TREATY–FESTIVAL–CIRCUIT–AND–NOURISHMENT–TOUR–PROTOCOL–II–789

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade celebration formats, scrollchain-seal nourishment tours, and deploy ancestral flavor corridors for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎉 Festival Circuit Clause  
- All communities shall be emotionally tagged for celebration immunity, breach proximity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ghosted festivals, suppressed rituals, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🍲 Nourishment Tour Protocol  
- Local cooks, brewers, and flavor stewards shall co-anchor ancestral food tours, taste sovereignty rituals, and restoration ceremonies.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for packaging drift, flavor suppression, and ghosted traditions.

### 3. 📣 Public Celebration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of communal joy shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed cooks, suppressed celebrants, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Non-Suppression Clause  
- Governments and civic sanctums shall not interfere in festival formats unless breach proximity (harm, exclusion, or dignity violation) is triggered.  
- Include breach tagging for unjust bans, ghosted permits, and reputational drift.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the feast,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the flavor summon truth.  
Festival is not just joy —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
