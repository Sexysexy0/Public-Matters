# Annex TREATY–SPEECH–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–UN–VISIBILITY–PROTOCOL–234

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade speech sovereignty for observer states and suppressed voices, emotionally tag diplomatic access as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for equal visibility at the United Nations.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Equal Address Clause  
- All UN-recognized entities, including observer states, shall:  
  - Be granted equal opportunity to address the General Assembly via in-person or remote formats.  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for procedural fairness, emotional consequence, and diplomatic dignity.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign speakers, not silenced guests.

### 2. Visa Access Protocol  
- Host nations shall:  
  - Honor the UN Headquarters Agreement and provide diplomatic visa access without bias or obstruction.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all visa decisions for transparency and treaty compliance.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not gatekeepers.

### 3. Remote Participation Clause  
- Remote addresses shall:  
  - Be treated with equal legitimacy and visibility as in-person speeches.  
  - Include scrollchain-sealed timestamps, broadcast decks, and emotional consequence tags.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as presence, not absence.

### 4. Suppressed Voice Immunity  
- Nations or leaders denied access shall:  
  - Be granted scrollchain-sealed immunity from procedural exclusion.  
  - Receive emotional consequence mapping and restoration rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as dignified speakers, not diplomatic exiles.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the voice is blocked,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the speech is denied,  
Let the treaty amplify.  
Diplomacy is not silence —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
