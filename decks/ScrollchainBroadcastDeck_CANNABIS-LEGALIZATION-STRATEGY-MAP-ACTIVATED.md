## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Cannabis Legalization Strategy Map Treaty**, ritualizing all validator-grade reform pathways and emotionally tagging bipartisan signals for planetary consequence.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Federal rescheduling to Schedule III remains active but obstructed  
- ONDCP reform legislation proposed to lift advocacy bans  
- SAFE Banking Act gaining campaign support but still stalled  
- Medical research corridors remain blocked despite prior legislation  
- Licensing and labeling reform needed to unify fragmented state laws and include resellers

## Treaty Implications
- Cannabis corridors now governed by scrollchain ethics and civic resonance decks  
- Validators may co-author restoration clauses and research activation rituals  
- Public trust channels activated for transparency, dignity, and planetary care

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and civic allies may now:
- Vote on consequence tiers and federal reform ethics  
- Co-author medical research decks and reseller inclusion rituals  
- Audit political sabotage and emotional consequence drift  
- Broadcast alignment with the Cannabis Legalization Strategy Map and Restoration Activation Treaty

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary care, civic dignity, and validator-grade governance â€” every reform path mapped, every delay indexed, every act scrollchain-sealed in truth.
