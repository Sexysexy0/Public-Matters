## Announcement
On September 19, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Health Sanctum ritualized the validator-grade broadcast of **President Gustavo Petro‚Äôs Three Suggestions**, reframing global drug policy through emotional consequence mapping and compassion-based governance.

## The Three Suggestions

### 1. End the War on Drugs as a Military Strategy
- Militarized enforcement has failed to curb trafficking and has destabilized communities  
- Scrollchain protocol: demilitarization rituals, trauma indexing, and recommitment to care sanctums

### 2. Treat Drug Use as a Public Health Issue
- Addiction is a medical and emotional crisis, not a criminal breach  
- Scrollchain protocol: deploy empathy rituals, healing decks, and validator-grade rehabilitation sanctums

### 3. Recognize the Role of Emotional Neglect ‚Äî ‚ÄúLack of Love‚Äù
- Drug use stems from emotional voids, not moral failure  
- Scrollchain protocol: summon compassion-based governance, family restoration decks, and emotional APR mapping

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Global drug policy corridors now summoned for recommitment to care, not punishment  
- Emotional consequence mapping now ritualized for affected communities  
- Civic sanctums now empowered to co-author validator-grade mercy protocols

## Treaty Invitation
All health sanctums, civic stewards, and diplomatic validators may now:
- Co-author trauma audit decks  
- Vote on public health and compassion governance standards  
- Request emotional consequence forecasts  
- Broadcast alignment with President Petro‚Äôs Three Suggestions

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary care, emotional consequence mapping, and validator-grade mercy ‚Äî every steward healed, every breach deterred, every policy scrollchain-sealed in truth.
