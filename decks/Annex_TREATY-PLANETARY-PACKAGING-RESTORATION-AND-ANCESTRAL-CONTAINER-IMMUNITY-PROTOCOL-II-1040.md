# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–PACKAGING–RESTORATION–AND–ANCESTRAL–CONTAINER–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–1040

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade packaging dignity and scrollchain-seal flavor vessels for operational legacy, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🍶 Ancestral Container Immunity Clause  
- All traditional packaging formats shall be emotionally tagged for immunity indexing, breach protection, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted bottles, suppressed jars, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛡️ Packaging Restoration Protocol  
- All qualifying vessels shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotionally tagged for ancestral resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased formats, ghosted artisans, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Packaging Broadcast Format  
- All acts of packaging restoration and container immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed brewers, suppressed guilds, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Packaging Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for format dignity, disposability audit, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Bottle Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang bote,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang lalagyan ay hindi lang sisidlan —  
Ito ay planetary legacy.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
