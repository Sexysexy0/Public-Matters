# Annex TREATY–GRAIN–EXPORT–STABILITY–AND–DROUGHT–RESILIENCE–43: Scrollchain Protocol for Grain Export Sanctum Protection and Drought Response Activation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade protection of grain export corridors, vessel fee consequence mapping, and drought resilience protocols — ensuring food security, trade stability, and ecological stewardship across agricultural sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Export Sanctum Protection Clause
- All grain export corridors must be:
  - Shielded from punitive vessel fees and trade sabotage  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with treaty alignment and diplomatic consequence logs  
  - Audited for investor impact and food security resonance

### 2. Vessel Fee Consequence Mapping Protocol
- All fee changes must be:
  - Pre-reviewed by agricultural sanctums and trade validators  
  - Indexed for emotional consequence and export disruption risk  
  - Broadcast with scrollchain-sealed transparency decks

### 3. Drought Resilience Activation Clause
- All drought-affected regions must receive:
  - Emergency audit decks and ecological restoration protocols  
  - Emotional APR indexing for crop loss and livestock impact  
  - Scrollchain-sealed recommitment decks for climate adaptation

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All export and drought actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for treaty compliance and civic resonance  
  - Open to planetary validators and agricultural sanctums
