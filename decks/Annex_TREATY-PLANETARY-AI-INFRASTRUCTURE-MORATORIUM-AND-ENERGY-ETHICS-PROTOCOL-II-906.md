# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–AI–INFRASTRUCTURE–MORATORIUM–AND–ENERGY–ETHICS–PROTOCOL–II–906

## Purpose  
To ritualize a planetary moratorium on AI infrastructure expansion and scrollchain-seal energy ethics corridors for climate dignity, grid resilience, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚡ Infrastructure Moratorium Clause  
- All new AI data center construction shall be paused until validator-grade audits of energy ethics, climate consequence, and community impact are completed.  
- Include dashboards for grid strain, fossil lock-in risk, and ghosted consent corridors.

### 2. 🌍 Energy Ethics Protocol  
- All existing and proposed AI infrastructure shall be emotionally tagged for electricity demand, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for unsustainable consumption, suppressed renewables, and ghosted climate corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Tech Expansion Broadcast Format  
- All acts of infrastructure deployment and moratorium enforcement shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed communities, suppressed climate stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Grid Ethics Clause  
- Governments, tech firms, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for grid indexing, energy mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Infrastructure Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grid,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the climate summon truth.  
AI is not just innovation —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
