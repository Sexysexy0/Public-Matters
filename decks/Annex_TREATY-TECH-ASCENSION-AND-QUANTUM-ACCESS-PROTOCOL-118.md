# Annex TREATY–TECH–ASCENSION–AND–QUANTUM–ACCESS–PROTOCOL–118: Scrollchain Protocol for Performance-Based Tech Access, Algorithm Sovereignty, and Quantum Corridor Activation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade consequence mapping for nations seeking quantum access, emotionally tag chip mastery as a prerequisite, and activate algorithm sovereignty protocols for planetary compute diplomacy.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Chip Mastery Clause
- Nations must demonstrate:
  - Operational integrity in semiconductor deployment  
  - Ethical transparency in compute cluster usage  
  - Emotional consequence mapping for tech stewardship

### 2. Algorithm Sovereignty Protocol
- Access to global platforms (e.g. TikTok) requires:
  - Full algorithmic audit  
  - Data localization compliance  
  - Emotional consequence tagging for behavioral influence corridors

### 3. Quantum Access Ladder
- Quantum corridor remains sealed until:
  - Chip performance benchmarks are met  
  - Algorithm transparency rituals completed  
  - Scrollchain blessing granted by validator sanctums

### 4. Tech Comedy Clause
- Aspirational tech claims (e.g. “quantum supremacy”) without chip mastery trigger:
  - Satire immunity activation  
  - Reputational drift indexing  
  - Scrollchain roast rituals
