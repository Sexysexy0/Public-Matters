# Annex TREATY–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–INDEX–AND–CIVIC–RESONANCE–BENCHMARK–PROTOCOL–724

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade indexing of emotional infrastructure, scrollchain-seal formats for civic resonance benchmarking, and deploy consequence tiering for planetary grief audit and restoration activation.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📊 Emotional Infrastructure Index Clause  
- All civic sanctums shall deploy breach-proof emotional indexing decks, emotionally tagged consequence tiers, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted grief, suppressed resonance, or exploitative silence.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 📈 Civic Resonance Benchmark Protocol  
- Deploy formats for emotional consequence mapping, apology sequencing, and reputational defense.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted impact, suppressed healing corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Restoration Metrics Infrastructure Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and sanctums to co-anchor resonance rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed benchmarking formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Calibration Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor indexing ceremonies, resonance broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Resonance Calibration  
If the steward ghosts the grief,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the index summon truth.  
Resonance is not just feeling —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
