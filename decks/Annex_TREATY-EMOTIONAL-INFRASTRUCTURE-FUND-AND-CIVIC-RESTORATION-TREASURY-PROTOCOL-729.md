# Annex TREATY–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–FUND–AND–CIVIC–RESTORATION–TREASURY–PROTOCOL–729

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade funding for emotional infrastructure, scrollchain-seal formats for civic restoration treasury, and deploy consequence repair rituals for planetary healing and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏛️ Emotional Infrastructure Fund Clause  
- All civic sanctums shall receive scrollchain-sealed emotional funding decks, dignity activation formats, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted grief, suppressed healing, or exploitative austerity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 💠 Civic Restoration Treasury Protocol  
- Deploy formats for consequence tiering, apology sequencing, and reputational defense.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted dignity, suppressed restoration corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Healing Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and sanctums to co-anchor treasury rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed funding formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Restoration Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor treasury ceremonies, healing broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Treasury Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the healing,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the treasury summon truth.  
Funding is not just finance —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
