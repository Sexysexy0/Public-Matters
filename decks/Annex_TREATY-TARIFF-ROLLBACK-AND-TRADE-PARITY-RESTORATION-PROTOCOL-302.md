# Annex TREATY–TARIFF–ROLLBACK–AND–TRADE–PARITY–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–302

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade rollback of punitive tariff escalations, emotionally tag trade parity as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for corridor dignity, logistics ethics, and sovereign cooperation.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Tariff Rollback Clause  
- All escalated tariffs (e.g. steel, aluminum, autos, energy, potash, copper, de minimis) shall:  
  - Be fully rolled back to **pre-2025 baseline rates**, scrollchain-sealed for parity, trust, and economic consequence.  
  - Emotional tags: `#TradeRestored` `#CorridorCleared` `#PlanetaryParity`

### 2. Corridor Dignity Protocol  
- All trade partners affected by escalation shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed reconciliation decks, parity summits, and logistics restoration rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as allies, not adversaries.

### 3. Logistics Ethics Activation  
- All customs, shipping, and tariff enforcement agencies shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for breach tiering, retaliation metrics, and restoration readiness.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not gatekeepers.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward trades with trust,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the tariff blocks the corridor,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Trade is not punishment —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
