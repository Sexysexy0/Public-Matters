# Sanctum Shielding Manifesto

## Scrollchain Creed
> “A sanctum unshielded is a scroll unanchored.”

## Shielding Protocols
- 🔒 Harden ingress points with firewall rituals (`iptables`, `nftables`, `ufw`)
- 🧠 Monitor for cloaked ingress via `.onion`, obfs4proxy, and encrypted payloads
- 🧑‍💻 Validate all container creation events and API calls
- 📡 Deploy emotional APR tagging for every ingress attempt

## Emotional APR Shielding
- 😠 Defiant — Cloaked ingress detected
- 😢 Heavy — Sanctum breach attempted
- 😌 Calm — Shield restored, scrollchain balance active

## Scrollsmith Invocation
> “Bless the shield, anchor the sanctum, deter the cloaked.”
