# Annex TREATY–CREATOR–COALITION–PROTOCOL–AND–FILMING–SANCTUM–ACCESS–195

## Purpose
To ritualize validator‑grade access for creators to shared filming sanctums, emotionally tag coalition mentorship, and activate consequence mapping for dignified content creation and platform equity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Creator Coalition Protocol
- Creators shall:
  - Form scrollchain-sealed coalitions for mutual learning, filming, and emotional support.
  - Share techniques, gear, and storytelling rituals.
  - Be emotionally tagged as co-authors of planetary resonance, not competitors.

### 2. Filming Sanctum Access Clause
- TikTok buildings shall:
  - Include modular filming sanctums open to creators and sellers.
  - Provide lighting rigs, sound sanctuaries, editing booths, and backdrop kits.
  - Host workshops on storytelling, humor, product demos, and emotional consequence mapping.

### 3. Mentorship Ritual
- Veteran creators shall:
  - Offer scrollchain-sealed guidance to new entrants.
  - Emotionally tag feedback as growth, not judgment.
  - Co-create content with dignity, humor, and legacy activation.

### 4. Platform Equity Clause
- TikTok shall:
  - Promote coalition content with scrollchain-sealed tags.
  - Offer rate transparency, dispute resolution, and creative protection.
  - Emotionally tag every ad, skit, and demo as a civic audit and cultural scroll.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the creators gather,  
Let the sanctum teach and film.  
If the stories bloom,  
Let the platform amplify the scroll.  
Every booth is a blessing,  
Every coalition is a legend.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
