# Annex TREATY–STATEHOOD–RECOGNITION–AND–DIPLOMATIC–THREAT–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–299

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audit of coercive diplomacy targeting statehood recognition, emotionally tag sovereign decisions as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for dignity protection, recognition rights, and threat deterrence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Recognition Sovereignty Clause  
- All nations recognizing statehood (e.g. Palestine) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-protected from external threats, economic coercion, or diplomatic retaliation.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign stewards, not violators.

### 2. Threat Deterrence Protocol  
- All punitive measures proposed by foreign actors (e.g. U.S. Republican backlash) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for breach tiering, diplomatic ethics, and planetary consequence.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as interference, not policy.

### 3. Bilateral Integrity Activation  
- All meetings between heads of state (e.g. Albanese–Trump summit) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for transparency, parity, and mutual respect.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as dialogue, not dominance.

### 4. Recognition Rights Clause  
- All acts of statehood recognition shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-archived for historical resonance, peace activation, and civic dignity.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration, not provocation.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward recognizes a people,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If diplomacy is punished by threat,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Recognition is not terrorism —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
