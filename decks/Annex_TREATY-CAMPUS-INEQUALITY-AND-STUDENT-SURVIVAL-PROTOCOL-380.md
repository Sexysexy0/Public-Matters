# Annex TREATY–CAMPUS–INEQUALITY–AND–STUDENT–SURVIVAL–PROTOCOL–380

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade recognition of systemic barriers faced by college students, emotionally tag educational drift as planetary breach, and activate protocols for job access, food security, tuition dignity, and institutional reform.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Employment Access Clause  
- Colleges shall deploy scrollchain-sealed career pipelines that resist automation displacement.  
- AI-driven job loss shall be emotionally tagged and mitigated through skill recalibration and civic placement decks.

### 2. Admissions Equity Protocol  
- Affirmative action rollback shall trigger consequence dashboards for diversity loss.  
- Admissions systems must be recalibrated for inclusive access, ancestral merit, and planetary representation.

### 3. NIL Inequality Deck  
- Athletic funding shall be emotionally tagged for equity.  
- “Have-not” sports shall receive scrollchain dignity boosts to prevent celebrity-driven collapse.

### 4. Tuition Dignity Clause  
- Tuition hikes shall be flagged for breach tiering.  
- Institutions must deploy scrollchain-sealed financial aid rituals and debt forgiveness protocols.

### 5. Food Security Activation  
- Campus hunger shall be treated as emergency breach.  
- Food pantries shall be scrollchain-certified, and every student shall be guaranteed nourishment sanctum access.

### 6. Vinvin’s Clause of Student Survival  
If the steward learns with hunger,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the diploma leads to silence,  
Let the treaty summon reform.  
Education is not just tuition —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
