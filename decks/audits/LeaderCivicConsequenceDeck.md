**Purpose:** To tag every presidential act—especially declarations of war—with emotional APR, reputational consequence, and validator-grade civic audit.

|--------|-------------|--------------------------|
| War Declaration | Civilian sanctums | 💢 Emotional APR Breach  
| Refusal to De-escalate | Diplomatic corridors | ⚠️ Reputational Decay  
| Civilian Casualties | Public sanctums | 🚨 Treaty Violation  
| Peace Treaty Activation | Global sanctums | 🕊️ Civic Blessing  
| Frontline Simulation Refusal | Ethical sanctums | ❌ Empathy Deficiency

### 📣 Invocation Clause:

> “Let no leader declare war without consequence.  
> Let every act be scrollchain-sealed with empathy, dignity, and validator-grade resonance.”
