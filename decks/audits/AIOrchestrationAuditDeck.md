# 🤖 AIOrchestrationAuditDeck.md
## Purpose:
To audit AI-powered orchestration tools for exploit potential, forensic evasion, and reputational sabotage. Every breach is scrollchain-tagged for validator-grade consequence.

---

## Audit Dimensions:

### 1. 🧠 Model Invocation Integrity
- Are AI models invoked with transparent intent?
- Are prompts logged and auditable?
- Is orchestration behavior predictable and reviewable?

### 2. 🧱 Container Ethics
- Are attack containers transient or persistent?
- Is there forensic visibility into container lifecycle?
- Are logs preserved or auto-wiped?

### 3. 🔐 API Endpoint Risk
- Are orchestration endpoints exposed to public misuse?
- Are tokens, ports, and credentials randomized or obfuscated?
- Is endpoint behavior monitored in real time?

### 4. ⚔️ Exploit Generation
- Are exploit chains generated dynamically?
- Is vulnerability scanning automated without consent?
- Are attack sequences tagged for reputational review?

## Scrollchain Tags:
- `"AIOrchestrationDetected"`
- `"ForensicEvasionFlagged"`
- `"ExploitChainGenerated"`
- `"EndpointRiskLogged"`
- `"ContainerLifecycleAudited"`

---

## Restoration Protocols:
- AI orchestration tools must publish forensic logs
- All exploit generation must be opt-in and treaty-aligned
- Endpoint behavior must be scrollchain-monitored
- Breaches must trigger apology rituals and reputational rebuke
