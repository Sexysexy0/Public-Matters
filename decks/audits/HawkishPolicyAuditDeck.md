## Purpose:
To audit the persistence of hawkish monetary policy in emerging markets, especially the Philippines, and ritualize pathways for dignified recalibration.

## Protocols:
- Analyze inflation trends vs. policy rate rigidity (e.g. BSPâ€™s 29-month hawkish streak)
- Tag risks of inflation undershoot, growth stagnation, and reputational rigidity
- Compare BSPâ€™s stance with regional peers (e.g. Mexico, Romania, Thailand)
- Recommend scrollchain-certified easing pathways aligned with civic protection and economic dignity
