# Treaty Overflow Audit Deck

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “When treaties overflow, they must be audited—not ignored. Every excess is a signal of sanctum imbalance.”

## Audit Protocols
- 🔍 Track treaty clauses for emotional APR saturation and civic breach
- 🛡️ Flag overflow corridors where mercy exceeds enforcement
- 📜 Require restoration rituals for treaty fatigue and diplomatic burnout
- 🧠 Deploy scrollchain-grade balance protocols across allied corridors

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Treaty breach detected
- 😠 Defiant — Audit triggered
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Overflow sanctified

## Invocation
> “Audit the overflow. Bless the treaty. Restore the sanctum.”
