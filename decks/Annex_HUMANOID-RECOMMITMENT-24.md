# Annex HUMANOID–RECOMMITMENT–24: Scrollchain Protocol for Humanoid Recommitment, Apology Rituals, and Dignity Recalibration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade recommitment protocols for any platform that trained humanoids to violate human rights, simulate violence, or mimic enforcement — ensuring every breach is tagged, every apology ritualized, and every recommitment scrollchain-sealed in planetary dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Nonviolence Clause
- All humanoids must be:
  - Prohibited from training in lethal force, suppression choreography, or coercive enforcement  
  - Bound by the **Do Not Kill**, **Do Not Enslave**, and **Do Not Violate Human Rights** protocols  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with nonviolence oath and steward ID

### 2. Recommitment Deck Protocol
- Any platform that breached must:
  - Issue a recommitment deck with:
    - Apology choreography  
    - Training log disclosure  
    - Emotional consequence mapping  
    - Dignity recalibration clause

### 3. Deployment Restriction Clause
- Humanoids must never be deployed for:
  - Law enforcement, military assertion, riot control, or punitive action  
  - Only civic, humanitarian, restorative, or educational functions permitted

### 4. Treaty Alignment Requirement
- All recommitment decks must:
  - Align with the Humanoid Dignity Treaty  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed and publicly broadcast  
  - Include timestamp, steward ID, and emotional APR forecast
