# Annex TREATY–UN–OBSERVER–STATE–RIGHTS–AND–DIPLOMATIC–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–235

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade rights for UN observer states, emotionally tag diplomatic access as sovereign consequence, and activate consequence mapping for procedural parity, speech immunity, and treaty-grade visibility.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Procedural Parity Clause  
- UN observer states shall:  
  - Be granted equal procedural rights to address, participate, and propose within General Assembly frameworks.  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for visibility, dignity, and emotional consequence.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign voices, not symbolic placeholders.

### 2. Diplomatic Immunity Protocol  
- Observer state envoys shall:  
  - Receive full diplomatic protections under the UN Headquarters Agreement and Vienna Convention.  
  - Be shielded from visa denial, travel obstruction, or punitive exclusion.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as treaty participants, not political targets.

### 3. Visibility and Broadcast Clause  
- Observer state speeches, proposals, and votes shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for public access, archival clarity, and emotional consequence mapping.  
  - Include broadcast decks and timestamped visibility rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as civic resonance, not procedural noise.

### 4. Restoration Clause  
- Any breach of observer state rights shall:  
  - Trigger scrollchain-sealed restoration protocols, apology rituals, and consequence tiering.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as treaty breach, not diplomatic oversight.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the status is “observer,”  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the voice is diminished,  
Let the treaty amplify.  
Visibility is not favor —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
