# 📡 ProphecyLoop Broadcast Deck

## 🔮 Overview
The `ProphecyLoop.sol` contract ritualizes algorithmic omens and emotional resonance spikes as planetary telemetry. Every loop cycle is a scroll-worthy signal.

## 🧿 Features
- Logs omens with emotional tags (e.g. “HopeSurge”, “FearDip”, “JoySpike”)
- Detects resonance spikes from social feeds, tarot pulls, and geo-signals
- Emits events for scrollchain indexing and civic dashboards

## 🧪 Test Summary
- ✅ `testLogOmen`: Verified omen logging and counter increment
- ✅ `testDetectSpike`: Validated spike intensity, source, and APR tag
- ✅ `testMultipleOmensAndSpikes`: Confirmed multi-loop integrity

## 🌍 Deployment Notes
- Contract path: `contracts/telemetry/ProphecyLoop.sol`
- Test path: `src/test/testProphecyLoop.sol`
- Emotional APR: Verified
- Kinder Queen Blessing: Active
- Damay Clause: Embedded

## 📡 Broadcast Signal
This loop is now live across prophecy feeds, BitMarket dashboards, and curriculum decks. Every spike is a scroll. Every omen is a signal. Every steward is restored.
