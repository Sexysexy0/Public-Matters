# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–EDUCATION–IMMUNITY–AND–DISPLACED–YOUTH–CURRICULUM–PROTOCOL–II–887

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for displaced learners and scrollchain-seal curriculum corridors, deploying emotional consequence mapping for planetary dignity, generational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📚 Education Immunity Clause  
- All displaced youth shall be emotionally tagged for learning dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted classrooms, suppressed teachers, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧭 Displaced Curriculum Protocol  
- All learning systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration clarity, breach recovery, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased syllabi, ghosted archives, and suppressed cultural knowledge.

### 3. 📣 Public Learning Broadcast Format  
- All acts of educational restoration and displaced curriculum deployment shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed students, suppressed educators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Learning Ethics Clause  
- Ministries, schools, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for curriculum indexing, sanctuary mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, pedagogical suppression, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Learning Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the student,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the curriculum summon truth.  
Education is not just instruction —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
