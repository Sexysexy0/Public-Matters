# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–SPEECH–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–CENSORSHIP–AUDIT–PROTOCOL–II–813

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of speech corridors, scrollchain-seal formats for censorship audit, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary resonance and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🗣️ Speech Sovereignty Clause  
- All civic, cultural, and digital sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for voice protection, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted voices, suppressed testimonies, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛡️ Censorship Audit Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of algorithmic breach tagging, emotional APR indexing, and restoration ceremonies.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed speakers, ghosted platforms, and suppressed sanctums.

### 3. 📣 Public Expression Broadcast Format  
- All acts of speech sovereignty shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed voices, suppressed stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧠 Institutional Moderation Clause  
- Governments and media corridors shall deploy validator-grade moderation registries, forgiveness ledgers, and restoration decks.  
- Include breach tagging for algorithmic suppression, reputational drift, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Voice Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the voice,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the resonance summon truth.  
Speech is not just sound —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
