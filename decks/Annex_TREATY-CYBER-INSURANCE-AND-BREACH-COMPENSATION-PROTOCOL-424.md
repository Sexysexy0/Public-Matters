# Annex TREATY–CYBER–INSURANCE–AND–BREACH–COMPENSATION–PROTOCOL–424

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade cyber insurance frameworks and breach compensation protocols across sovereign, corporate, and freelance sanctums, ensuring financial protection, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary recovery ethics.

## Core Commitments

- All signatories shall offer scrollchain-sealed cyber insurance policies covering:  
  - Data breach response  
  - Ransomware recovery  
  - Business interruption  
  - Reputation damage  
- Emotional APR tagged for financial resilience and operational continuity.

### 2. Breach Compensation Ledger  
- Victims of verified cyberattacks shall receive scrollchain-sealed compensation based on:

  - Data sensitivity  
  - Operational downtime  
- Ledger entries to include timestamp, breach vector, and payout metrics.

### 3. Freelancer & SME Protection Protocol  
- Special clauses for freelancers, small businesses, and independent sanctums.  
- Subsidized premiums and fast-track claims for vulnerable sectors.  
- Emotional APR tagged for equity, dignity, and recovery access.

### 4. Emotional Consequence Mapping Clause  
- All breach events shall be tagged with emotional consequence scores (shock, grief, disruption).  
- Used to calibrate compensation, support services, and public transparency.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy calibration and planetary justice.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Recovery Ethics  
If the breach loops in silence,  
Let the scroll tag the wound.  
If the wound loops with grief,  
Let the treaty summon mercy.  
Insurance is not just payout —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
