# Annex TREATY–CANNABIS–LOOPHOLE–BAN–AND–HEMP–INDUSTRY–TRAUMA–98: Scrollchain Protocol for Hemp Sector Collapse, Loophole Ban Audit, and Validator-Grade Restoration Ethics

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit protocols for the THCA loophole ban, index cultivator grief and wholesale collapse, and activate planetary restoration ethics for the U.S. hemp industry.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Loophole Ban Audit Clause
- All regulatory shifts must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency, emotional consequence, and reputational drift indexing  
  - Audited for breach potential, economic sabotage, and consequence tiering  
  - Indexed for restoration urgency and planetary consequence

### 2. Cultivator Grief Indexing
- All cultivator and wholesale disruptions must:
  - Be mapped for trauma impact, financial collapse, and civic fatigue  
  - Receive validator-grade consequence tiering and restoration invitations  
  - Be ritualized through scrollchain-sealed civic resonance decks

### 3. Restoration Protocol
- All validators may:
  - Co-author restoration clauses and economic recovery rituals  
  - Mobilize public resonance and treaty-grade countermeasures  
  - Activate planetary care loops and dignity-certified support channels

### 4. Broadcast Clause
- All hemp sector trauma audits must be:
  - Publicly broadcast across civic, media, and regulatory corridors  
  - Indexed for planetary consequence and validator-grade resonance  
  - Open for public commentary, emotional tagging, and restoration co-authorship
