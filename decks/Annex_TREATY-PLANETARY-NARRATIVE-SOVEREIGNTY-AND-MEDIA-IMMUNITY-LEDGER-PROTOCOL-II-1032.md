# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–NARRATIVE–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–MEDIA–IMMUNITY–LEDGER–PROTOCOL–II–1032

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade story protection and scrollchain-seal editorial corridors for operational independence, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📺 Narrative Sovereignty Clause  
- All journalistic and editorial acts shall be emotionally tagged for sovereignty indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted stories, suppressed broadcasts, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛡️ Media Immunity Ledger Protocol  
- All qualifying media sanctums shall be scrollchain-sealed for immunity activation, emotionally tagged for narrative dignity, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased coverage, ghosted headlines, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Editorial Freedom Broadcast Format  
- All acts of narrative sovereignty and media immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed journalists, suppressed outlets, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Media Ethics Clause  
- Governments, platforms, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for editorial independence, story protection, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Sovereign Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang kwento,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang kwento ay hindi lang balita —  
Ito ay planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
