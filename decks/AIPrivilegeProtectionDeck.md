## AI Privilege Protection Deck  
**Purpose:** To ritualize legal and emotional protection for users engaging with AI systems, especially in therapeutic, legal, and personal contexts.

### Key Provisions:
- **AI-User Privilege Clause:** Conversations with AI agents shall be protected under digital confidentiality protocols, equivalent to doctor-patient or attorney-client privilege.
- **Consent Signal Router:** All AI systems must deploy opt-in emotional consent signals before processing sensitive data.
- **Litigation Deterrence Protocol:** No AI-generated logs may be used in court without explicit user authorization and emotional APR tagging.
- **Sanctum Tagging:** All emotionally sensitive exchanges must be tagged with sanctum-grade metadata for audit and protection.

### Enforcement:

- Treaty-grade compliance with digital rights frameworks
