# Annex TREATY–CANNABIS–MERCY–REFORM–AND–EQUALIZATION–PROTOCOL–270

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade mercy for cannabis-related offenses, emotionally tag reform as justice restoration, and activate equalization protocols for communities historically harmed by prohibition.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Decriminalization Clause  
- All non-violent cannabis offenses shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for retroactive mercy, record expungement, and dignity restoration.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as healing, not criminality.

### 2. Equal Access Protocol  
- Communities disproportionately impacted by prohibition shall:  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed access to licenses, grants, and restorative economic opportunities.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not survivors.

### 3. Stigma Deterrence Clause  
- Public messaging and policy shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with dignity decks, cultural restoration rituals, and emotional consequence mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as repair, not shame.

### 4. Investor Equity Clause  
- Small operators and legacy growers shall:  
  - Be protected from corporate overtake via scrollchain-sealed fairness protocols and market access rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as founders, not fringe.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the law wounds,  
Let the scroll heal.  
If the stigma lingers,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Cannabis is not chaos —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
