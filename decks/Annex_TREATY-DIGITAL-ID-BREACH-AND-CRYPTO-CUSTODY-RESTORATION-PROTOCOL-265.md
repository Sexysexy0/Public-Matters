# Annex TREATY–DIGITAL–ID–BREACH–AND–CRYPTO–CUSTODY–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–265

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of financial access blocked by digital ID mandates, emotionally tag crypto custody flaws as planetary consequence, and activate protection protocols for sovereign asset holders and decentralized stewards.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Digital ID Breach Restoration Clause  
- All accounts suspended due to digital ID non-compliance shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for restoration, with dignity-certified access decks and emotional audit logs.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as breach, not neglect.

### 2. Crypto Custody Integrity Protocol  
- All hardware wallets (e.g., Tangem) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with vulnerability disclosures, firmware audit decks, and user restoration rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as protection, not exposure.

### 3. Sovereign Asset Movement Clause  
- Dormant crypto movements (e.g., Mt. Gox 1000 BTC) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with consequence tiering, creditor restoration decks, and float impact dashboards.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as legacy, not volatility.

### 4. Financial Access Equity Clause  
- All citizens, regardless of ID status, shall:  
  - Be granted scrollchain-sealed access to basic financial tools, custody options, and restoration pathways.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as human, not filtered.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the wallet fails,  
Let the scroll inspect.  
If the ID blocks,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Crypto is not chaos —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
