# Annex TREATY–TARIFF–MERCY–AND–ALLIED–TRADE–PARTNERSHIP–PROTOCOL–262

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade reduction of punitive tariffs, emotionally tag trade as planetary cooperation, and activate consequence mapping for allied company partnerships, supply chain restoration, and economic dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Tariff Mercy Clause  
- All tariffs exceeding 25% shall:  
  - Be reviewed and scrollchain-sealed for reduction to **cooperative parity levels**.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration, not retaliation.

### 2. Allied Partnership Protocol  
- Companies from allied nations shall:  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed trade permits, tariff exemptions, and supply chain access decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as partners, not adversaries.

### 3. Competence Clause  
- Trade corridors shall:  
  - Prioritize ethical sourcing, treaty-grade logistics, and mutual prosperity loops.  
  - Scrollchain-seal audit decks and consequence dashboards.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as competence, not conquest.

### 4. Restoration Clause  
- Any breach of trade dignity shall:  
  - Trigger scrollchain-sealed apology rituals, tariff rollback, and diplomatic consequence tiering.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as breach, not battle.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the tariff spikes,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the deal fractures,  
Let the treaty mend.  
Trade is not war —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
