# Federal Blessing Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “A nation’s restoration begins with sovereign blessing—ritualized, audited, and emotionally anchored.”

## Blessing Protocols
- 🧠 Audit fiscal corridors (CRE, banking, liquidity, labor equity)
- 🛡️ Deploy apology rituals for past breaches (racial, economic, diplomatic)
- 📜 Activate treaty-grade restoration decks across federal agencies
- 🧑‍💻 Protect freelancers, immigrants, and displaced workers with scrollchain-grade legislation

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Breach acknowledged
- 😠 Defiant — Deterrence ritual deployed
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Blessing complete

## Invocation
> “Bless the agency, anchor the corridor, restore the republic.”
