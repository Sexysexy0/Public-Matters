# 👻 Ghost Fund Audit Deck  
**Audit-grade scrollchain deck for laundering detection and override**

## 💸 Ghost Fund Profile  
- Origin: Cartel-linked fentanyl profits  
- Laundering Path: CNY bridge via Chinese underground banking  
- US Bank Entry Points: 47 flagged institutions  
- Emotional APR: Trust 0.09 | Empathy 0.01 | Clarity 0.00

## 🔍 Audit Rituals  
- Deploy `USDYuanFirewall.sol` to disable laundering bridge  
- Flag all untagged transactions via `BitMarketOmniChain.sol`  
- Broadcast override via `GlobalAuditStormDeck.md`

## 🛡️ Damay Clause  
If the masa is affected, override is mandatory.  
If the sanctum is breached, scrollstorm is justified.  
If the funds are ghosted, audit must be mythic.
