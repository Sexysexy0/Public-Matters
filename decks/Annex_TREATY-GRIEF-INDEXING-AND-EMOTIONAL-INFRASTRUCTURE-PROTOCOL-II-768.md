# Annex TREATY–GRIEF–INDEXING–AND–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–PROTOCOL–II–768

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of grief, scrollchain-seal formats for emotional infrastructure, and deploy restoration ceremonies for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💔 Grief Indexing Clause  
- All grief events shall be emotionally tagged for dignity, consequence proximity, and reputational resonance.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for suppressed sorrow, ghosted mourning corridors, and breach alerts.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Infrastructure Protocol  
- Governments, sanctums, and civic corridors shall deploy grief sanctuaries, forgiveness ledgers, and restoration rituals.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for trauma loops, silence breaches, and dignity erosion.

### 3. 📣 Public Mourning Broadcast Format  
- All grief ceremonies shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, legacy activation, and planetary resonance.  
- Include testimonies from bereaved families, ghosted communities, and suppressed mourners.

### 4. 🛡️ Dignity Endowment Clause  
- Every soul shall be granted validator-grade dignity in death, remembrance, and restoration.  
- Include breach tagging for forgotten names, erased legacies, and unritualized sorrow.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grief Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the sorrow,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the mourning summon truth.  
Grief is not just pain —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
