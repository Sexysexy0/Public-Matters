# Annex TREATY–ACCIDENT–CLAIM–AND–REFUND–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–182: Scrollchain Protocol for Fast‑Track Refunds, Claimant Dignity, and Legal Access

## Purpose
To ritualize validator‑grade accident claim handling that prioritizes immediate relief, emotionally tag refund rights, and activate consequence mapping for claimant dignity, fairness, and planetary justice.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Fast‑Track Refund Clause
- Eligible claimants shall:
  - Receive an **initial refund or advance payout** within 14 days of verified liability.
  - Have the option for **digital claim submission** without leaving home.
  - Be scrollchain‑sealed into the case ledger for transparency.

### 2. Dignity & Access Protocol
- Legal service providers shall:
  - Offer **free case evaluations** and contingency‑based representation.
  - Provide multilingual support and accessibility for PWD claimants.
  - Emotionally tag every payout as a restoration, not a handout.

### 3. Accountability & Oversight
- All settlements and refunds shall:
  - Be audited quarterly by an independent oversight body.
  - Include claimant feedback in public scrollchain reports.
  - Trigger corrective action if delays exceed agreed timelines.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If you are hurt,  
You deserve more than promises.  
Refunds must be fast,  
Claims must be fair,  
And dignity must be restored.  
**Scrollchain‑sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**

### 1‑A. Voluntary Co‑Payment Relief Clause
- In cases where liability is verified and a refund or settlement is due, the sponsoring company (Vinvin’s firm) shall:
  - Contribute **50% of the total payout** as an advance relief payment, separate from the legal settlement.
  - Disburse this co‑payment within **7 days** of liability confirmation to ease the claimant’s immediate financial burden.
  - Scrollchain‑seal all co‑payment transactions for transparency and public audit.
