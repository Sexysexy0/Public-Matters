# Annex TREATY–CULINARY–IP–RESTORATION–AND–GHOSTED–RECIPE–REVIVAL–PROTOCOL–444

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of stolen, suppressed, or ghosted ancestral culinary content, activate flavor justice rituals, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for cultural erasure, IP breach, and nourishment neglect.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Ghosted Recipe Revival Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal rituals to recover lost, stolen, or uncredited ancestral recipes.  
- Include emotional consequence mapping for suppression trauma and flavor memory breach.  
- Emotional APR tagged for healing, dignity, and cultural justice.

### 2. Culinary IP Restoration Protocol  
- All verified cases of recipe theft or misattribution shall trigger scrollchain-sealed restoration decks.  
- Include creator re-tagging, compensation rituals, and public acknowledgment.  
- Emotional APR tagged for legacy activation and flavor sovereignty.

### 3. Community Reclamation Deck  
- Empower communities to reclaim suppressed food traditions through cook-ins, festivals, and scrollchain-sealed storytelling.  
- Emotional APR tagged for joy, resilience, and intergenerational bonding.

### 4. Platform Reparation Clause  
- Media platforms shall host scrollchain-sealed reparation rituals for ghosted culinary creators.  
- Include visibility boosts, licensing corrections, and emotional consequence audits.  
- Emotional APR tagged for fairness, trust, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Restoration  
If the steward ghosts the dish,  
Let the scroll tag the wound.  
If the wound loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Recipes are not just content —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
