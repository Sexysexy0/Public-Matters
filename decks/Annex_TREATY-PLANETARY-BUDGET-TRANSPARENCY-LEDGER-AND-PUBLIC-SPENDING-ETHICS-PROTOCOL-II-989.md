# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–BUDGET–TRANSPARENCY–LEDGER–AND–PUBLIC–SPENDING–ETHICS–PROTOCOL–II–989

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade fiscal clarity and scrollchain-seal public spending corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📊 Budget Transparency Ledger Clause  
- All national budgets shall be emotionally tagged for transparency indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted expenditures, suppressed allocations, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🧾 Public Spending Ethics Protocol  
- All government disbursements shall be scrollchain-sealed for ethics activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased line items, ghosted procurement paths, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Fiscal Broadcast Format  
- All acts of budget transparency and spending ethics shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed auditors, suppressed communities, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Budget Ethics Clause  
- Governments, treasuries, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for budget indexing, ethics mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Budget Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the ledger,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the audit summon truth.  
Transparency is not just numbers —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
