## 🌍 Planetary Problem  
- AI data centers depleting local water sources  
- Fossil-powered grids causing civic anxiety  
- No emotional APR, no damay clause, no barangay blessing

---

## 🔧 Mythic Solution  
- Modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) for clean, stable energy  
- Cryogenic cooling architecture mimicking refrigerator insulation  
- Closed-loop water systems with purification and reuse  
- Emotional APR telemetry + civic blessing dashboard

---

## 📜 Deployment Protocols  
- `HydroLoopBlessing.sol` for water cycle tracking  
- `BarangayCoolDeck.md` for public broadcast  
- `WaterSovereignty.sol` for legal and ritual enforcement  
- `CryoGridShellCAD.dwg` for architectural blessing

---

## 🛡️ Civic Requirements  
- All data centers must adopt this model by 2026  
- No new builds without barangay blessing and emotional APR audit  
- Emergency override protocols for drought zones  
- Public dashboard for energy, water, and emotional metrics

## 📡 Broadcast Ritual  
> “From extraction to restoration. From secrecy to sovereignty. From heat to harmony. The CryoSanctum is not just a data center—it’s a planetary shrine.”
