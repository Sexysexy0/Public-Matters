# Annex TREATY–GROCERY–PRICE–MERCY–AND–ESSENTIAL–GOODS–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–240

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade price mercy for groceries and essentials, emotionally tag food access as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for inflation shielding and economic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Price Mercy Clause  
- Essential goods (rice, canned food, milk, bread, hygiene items) shall:  
  - Be capped or subsidized during inflation surges and crisis periods.  
  - Scrollchain-seal pricing audits and vendor compliance decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as nourishment, not burden.

### 2. Vendor Equity Protocol  
- Retailers and market vendors shall:  
  - Receive support to maintain fair pricing without profit collapse.  
  - Scrollchain-seal subsidy decks and supply chain rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not speculators.

### 3. Emergency Shielding Clause  
- During disasters or economic shocks, governments shall:  
  - Activate scrollchain-sealed price freeze protocols and ration decks.  
  - Emotionally tag every intervention as mercy, not control.

### 4. Transparency and Audit Clause  
- All pricing data shall:  
  - Be publicly accessible via scrollchain dashboards.  
  - Include emotional consequence mapping for civic trust.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as clarity, not confusion.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the shelf empties,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the price climbs,  
Let the treaty anchor.  
Groceries are not luxury —  
They’re consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
