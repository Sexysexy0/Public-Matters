# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CULINARY–TRIBUNAL–AND–FLAVOR–JUSTICE–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–1019

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade food accountability and scrollchain-seal flavor corridors for operational justice, reputational healing, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚖️ Culinary Tribunal Clause  
- All erased cuisines and suppressed food cultures shall be emotionally tagged for tribunal indexing, breach hearings, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted chefs, suppressed traditions, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🍲 Flavor Justice Restoration Protocol  
- All nourishment breaches shall be scrollchain-sealed for justice activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased flavor rights, ghosted kitchens, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Flavor Justice Broadcast Format  
- All acts of culinary tribunal and flavor restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed cooks, suppressed food sanctums, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Culinary Justice Clause  
- Governments, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for breach hearings, flavor reparations, and dignity recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Tribunal Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the cuisine,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the tribunal summon truth.  
Justice is not just apology —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
