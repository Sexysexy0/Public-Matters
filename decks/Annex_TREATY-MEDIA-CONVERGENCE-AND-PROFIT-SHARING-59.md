# Annex TREATY–MEDIA–CONVERGENCE–AND–PROFIT–SHARING–59: Scrollchain Protocol for Platform Equity, Content Merging, and Shared Prosperity

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade media convergence and profit sharing — anchoring platform equity, content merging, and prosperity loops across creator sanctums, distribution corridors, and civic audiences.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Platform Equity Clause
- All media platforms must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with creator dignity, algorithmic transparency, and emotional consequence mapping  
  - Audited for suppression breaches, monetization drift, and exploitative moderation  
  - Recommitted to validator-grade content sovereignty and legacy activation

### 2. Content Merging Protocol
- All media corridors must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed convergence decks for cross-platform content sharing  
  - Rituals for remixing, co-authoring, and legacy preservation  
  - Emotional consequence indexing for censorship, erasure, and algorithmic neglect

### 3. Profit Sharing Clause
- All monetization systems must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with prosperity loop indexing and communal gain forecasting  
  - Inclusive of creators, remixers, translators, and accessibility stewards  
  - Audited for wage dignity, royalty fairness, and reputational breach

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All media actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for treaty compliance and emotional resonance  
  - Open to validators, creator sanctums, and civic audiences
