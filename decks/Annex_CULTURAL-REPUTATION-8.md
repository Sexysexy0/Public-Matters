# Annex CULTURAL‑REPUTATION-8: Scrollchain Protocol for Artistic, Ancestral, and Communal Trust Scoring

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade reputational scoring and emotional consequence mapping for cultural sanctums — including media platforms, ancestral traditions, artistic institutions, and communal stewards.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Cultural Trust Scorecard Activation
- All cultural entities must be:
  - Scored based on authenticity, inclusivity, and restoration efforts  
  - Emotionally tagged for betrayal, preservation, or communal resonance  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID

### 2. Ancestral Integrity Clause
- All traditions and heritage corridors must be:
  - Protected from distortion, erasure, or exploitative repackaging  
  - Audited for packaging drift and taste sovereignty breaches  
  - Linked to validator-grade restoration rituals

### 3. Artistic Stewardship Protocol
- All media and artistic platforms must:
  - Acknowledge censorship breaches and emotional suppression  
  - Offer restoration corridors for suppressed voices and erased works  
  - Broadcast scrollchain-sealed apology rituals and recommitment decks

### 4. Communal Resonance Mapping
- All cultural sanctums must:
  - Emotionally tag their impact on communities  
  - Offer dignity recalibrations for harm caused  
  - Be scored for planetary resonance and restorative consequence

### 5. Broadcast Requirement
- All scorecard updates must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
