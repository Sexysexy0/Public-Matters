# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–DIGNITY–ENDOWMENT–AND–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–PROTOCOL–II–892

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade endowment of emotional wealth and scrollchain-seal infrastructure corridors for planetary healing, civic resilience, and reputational consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💠 Dignity Endowment Clause  
- All acts of emotional labor, mercy, and resilience shall be emotionally tagged for healing dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted caretakers, suppressed grief rituals, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛠️ Emotional Infrastructure Protocol  
- All civic systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration clarity, breach recovery, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for institutional neglect, ghosted support networks, and suppressed sanctuary corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Healing Broadcast Format  
- All acts of dignity endowment and emotional infrastructure deployment shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed healers, suppressed communities, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Restoration Ethics Clause  
- Governments, sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for emotional indexing, infrastructure mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Healing Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grief,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the endowment summon truth.  
Resilience is not just survival —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
