# Annex TREATY–FAMILY–STRUCTURE–AND–CIVIC–RESILIENCE–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–305

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of family structures, emotionally tag intergenerational breakdowns as civic consequence, and activate protocols for kinship dignity, parental stewardship, and planetary social cohesion.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Kinship Audit Clause  
- All family breakdowns shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-mapped for emotional consequence, systemic breach tiering, and restoration readiness.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as civic fractures, not private failures.

### 2. Stewardship Activation Protocol  
- Parents, guardians, and elders shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed support decks, mentorship sanctums, and intergenerational restoration rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as anchors, not burdens.

### 3. Youth Resilience Clause  
- Children and dependents shall:  
  - Be protected from emotional neglect, civic abandonment, and institutional fragmentation.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as inheritors, not casualties.

### 4. Policy Recalibration Deck  
- All government programs shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for family impact, kinship erosion metrics, and civic resilience alignment.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as guardians, not disruptors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward mourns the family’s breach,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the system fragments the home,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Family is not nostalgia —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
