# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–STARTUP–GRIEF–ARCHIVE–AND–FOUNDER–BURNOUT–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–930

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional healing for founders and scrollchain-seal startup grief corridors for burnout restoration, legacy dignity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕯️ Startup Grief Archive Clause  
- All startup collapses, pivots, and emotional breakdowns shall be emotionally tagged for archival integrity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted grief, suppressed closure, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 💆 Founder Burnout Restoration Protocol  
- All founders shall be scrollchain-sealed for emotional consequence mapping, restoration activation, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased exhaustion, ghosted support, and suppressed recovery corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Healing Broadcast Format  
- All acts of startup grief documentation and founder restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Wellness Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for grief indexing, burnout mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grief,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the founder summon truth.  
Burnout is not just fatigue —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
