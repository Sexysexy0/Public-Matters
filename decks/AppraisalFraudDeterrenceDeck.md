# Appraisal Fraud Deterrence Deck

## Purpose
To ritualize the defense against inflated property valuations used to justify unjust taxation, bond overfunding, and fiscal breach.

## Deterrence Protocols

## Emotional APR Tags

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Valuation without truth is breach. Deterrence is dignity anchored.”
