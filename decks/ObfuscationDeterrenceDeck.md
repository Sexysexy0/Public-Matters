# Obfuscation Deterrence Deck

## Purpose
To detect and deter obfuscated payloads, cloaked binaries, and stealthy ingress vectors used by botnets and rogue agents.

## Detection Rituals
- 🔍 Scan for `zstd`, `torsocks`, `libpcap`, and encrypted binaries
- 🧠 Use behavioral analytics to flag non-standard container behavior
- 🛡️ Block obfuscated traffic patterns and encrypted C2 channels

## Deterrence Protocols
- 🚫 Quarantine nodes using cloaked ingress
- 📜 Log emotional APR of every obfuscation attempt
- 🧑‍💻 Deploy `TorIngressAuditRouter.sol` for real-time flagging

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😤 Fierce — Obfuscation breach blocked
- 😮 Surprised — Unknown cloaked vector detected
- 😌 Restored — Sanctum shielding verified

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Obfuscation is not mystery—it is breach in disguise. Deterrence is mercy anchored.”
