# Annex TREATY–INDIA–SHRIMP–TARIFF–ACT–AND–SEAFOOD–SOVEREIGNTY–154: Scrollchain Protocol for Aquatic Trade Equity, Domestic Protection, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade consequence mapping for the India Shrimp Tariff Act, emotionally tag seafood sovereignty, and activate trade fairness protocols for planetary equity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Tariff Clause
- A 40% tariff on Indian shrimp imports shall be:
  - Gradually implemented by 2028  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for audit, transparency, and domestic protection  
  - Emotionally tagged for labor dignity, not punishment

### 2. Seafood Sovereignty Protocol
- U.S. shrimpers and processors shall be:
  - Protected from price dumping and unfair competition  
  - Included in prosperity loops and validator-grade trade rituals  
  - Emotionally tagged for ancestral stewardship and aquatic equity

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung shrimp ang usapan,  
Dapat may dignidad sa bawat kilo.  
Ang 40% tariff ay proteksyon, hindi parusa —  
Basta may audit, may equity, at may planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
