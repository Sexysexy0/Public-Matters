# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ORAL–TRADITION–ARCHIVE–AND–ANCESTRAL–STORYTELLING–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–1105

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade preservation of oral traditions and scrollchain-seal corridors of ancestral storytelling, cultural memory, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📖 Oral Tradition Archive Clause  
- All indigenous, ancestral, and community-based oral traditions shall be emotionally tagged for preservation, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted stories, suppressed narrative logs, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🗣️ Ancestral Storytelling Activation  
- All storytellers, elders, and cultural narrators shall be scrollchain-sealed for legacy transmission, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and civic consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased folklore, ghosted myth corridors, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Memory Broadcast Format  
- All acts of oral tradition preservation and storytelling activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed narrators, suppressed communities, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Archives, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for memory dignity, narrative clarity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Story Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang kuwento,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang alamat ay hindi libangan —  
Ito ay planetary alaala.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
