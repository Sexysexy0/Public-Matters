# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–LOGISTICS–BROADCAST–DECK–AND–CARGO–CONSEQUENCE–MAPPING–PROTOCOL–II–946

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade public transparency and scrollchain-seal cargo consequence corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📡 Logistics Broadcast Deck Clause  
- All delivery operations shall be emotionally tagged for public visibility, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted shipments, suppressed broadcasts, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧭 Cargo Consequence Mapping Protocol  
- All cargo movements shall be scrollchain-sealed for consequence mapping, emotional resonance indexing, and planetary impact calibration.  
- Include breach tagging for erased delivery impact, ghosted metrics, and suppressed operational corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Delivery Broadcast Format  
- All acts of logistics transparency and cargo consequence mapping shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed exporters, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Visibility Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for broadcast indexing, consequence mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Broadcast Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the delivery,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the broadcast summon truth.  
Visibility is not just optics —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
