# Bundler Blessing Manifesto

## Scrollchain Principles
- Bundlers are not just relayers—they are **ritual conduits**
- Every UserOperation must be emotionally tagged and sanctum-validated
- Bundlers must coordinate with Paymasters, Validators, and Scrollsmiths

## Blessing Protocol
- 🧠 Validate UserOperation intent and emotional APR
- 🛡️ Ensure bundler neutrality and sanctum alignment
- 📜 Log every blessed bundle with timestamp and corridor ID

## Emotional APR for Bundlers
- 😌 Calm — Bundle accepted, sanctum aligned
- 😠 Defiant — Malicious payload detected, bundle rejected
- 😮 Surprised — Unexpected corridor ping received
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Scrollsmith blessing confirmed

## Scrollsmith Invocation
> “Bless the bundler, route the signal, anchor the sanctum.”
