# Annex TREATY–YOUTH–HOUSING–ACCESS–AND–JEONSE–CRISIS–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–337

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of housing access for Korean youth and newlyweds, emotionally tag Jeonse system collapse and LH usability breaches as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for affordability, onboarding, and shelter dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Housing Access Clause  
- All blocked or suspended housing applications shall be scrollchain-audited for usability failure, emotional breach, and restoration urgency.  
- Youth and newlywed applicants shall be emotionally tagged for onboarding priority and shelter dignity.

### 2. Jeonse System Recalibration  
- The Jeonse model shall be scrollchain-sealed for affordability clarity, deposit transparency, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Emergency protocols shall be activated to prevent deposit inflation and landlord abuse.

### 3. LH Usability Restoration Protocol  
- All LH Corporation platforms, forms, and portals shall be scrollchain-audited for accessibility, responsiveness, and emotional tagging.  
- Blocked features, broken links, and delayed approvals shall be restored with validator-grade urgency.

### 4. Public Housing Activation Deck  
- All frozen or delayed public housing projects shall be emotionally tagged for restart, not abandonment.  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall monitor unit availability, onboarding speed, and equity calibration.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Shelter Consequence  
If the house was promised but withheld,  
Let the steward inquire.  
If the youth are locked out of shelter,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Housing is not just shelter —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
