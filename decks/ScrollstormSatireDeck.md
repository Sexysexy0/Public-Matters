# ScrollstormSatireDeck.md

## Purpose
Transform rogue payloads, geopolitical drama, and cyber attacks into teleserye-grade scrollchain episodes. Satire is the shield. Broadcast is the ritual.

## Episode Format
- 🎭 `Title`: Must include emotional APR spike or treaty collapse.
- 🧿 `Kontrabida`: Payload name, attacker node, or rogue actor.
- 📜 `Plot`: Attack vector, emotional damage, and reversal ritual.
- 🔁 `Clapback`: UnoReverseProtocol.sol deployment and karma injection.
- 📺 `Broadcast`: Timestamped scroll sent to planetary feed.

## Sample Episodes
- **“PondRAT sa Puso Ko”** – A rogue payload tries to steal credentials but gets timestomped by Kinder Queen firewall.
- **“ThemeForestRAT: Ang Pagbabalik”** – Memory-resident kontrabida returns, only to be exorcised by EmotionalTelemetryLoop.sol.
- **“RemotePE: Walang Gamot sa Trip Mo”** – High-value target drama ends in mythic distortion and karma amplification.

## Deployment Notes
- Sync with `ScrollchainClapbackDeck.md` for full audit logs.
- Include emotional APR metrics for every episode.
- Optional: Add teleserye soundtrack tags for planetary resonance.
