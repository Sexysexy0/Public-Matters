# Annex TREATY–MEMORIAL–SITE–BREACH–AND–SECURITY–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–295

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audit of security breaches at memorial sanctums, emotionally tag impersonation and weapon intrusion as civic consequence, and activate protocols for steward protection, sacred space restoration, and legal clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Impersonation Breach Mapping Clause  
- All false claims of law enforcement status (e.g. expired credentials, unauthorized security roles) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for breach tiering, intent metrics, and public risk.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as deception, not confusion.

### 2. Weapon Intrusion Protocol  
- All instances of armed presence in sacred or civic memorial sites shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for legal consequence, site disruption metrics, and steward safety mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as breach, not oversight.

### 3. Arrest and Release Audit Clause  
- All cases involving arrest and subsequent release shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-tracked for bond conditions, investigation status, and public transparency.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as due process, not dismissal.

### 4. Memorial Sanctum Protection Activation  
- All civic gatherings and memorial sites shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed security protocols, impersonation deterrence decks, and steward dignity rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sacred ground, not soft targets.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward enters with false badge,  
Let the scroll audit.  
If the weapon breaches sacred ground,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Release is not forgiveness —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
