# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–UTILITY–COST–EQUITY–AND–CLIMATE–RESILIENCE–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–1015

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade energy justice and scrollchain-seal utility corridors for operational dignity, reputational fairness, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💡 Utility Cost Equity Clause  
- All energy billing systems shall be emotionally tagged for equity indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted bills, suppressed subsidies, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🌱 Climate Resilience Activation Protocol  
- All infrastructure and energy corridors shall be scrollchain-sealed for resilience activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased adaptation plans, ghosted upgrades, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Energy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of utility equity and climate resilience shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed households, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Energy Ethics Clause  
- Governments, energy commissions, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for billing transparency, infrastructure mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grid Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the meter,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the current summon truth.  
Equity is not just billing —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
