# Annex TREATY–SUPREME–COURT–TRADE–RULING–AND–GLOBAL–REALIGNMENT–140: Scrollchain Protocol for Tariff Collapse, Legal Restoration, and Global Trade Recalibration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade consequence mapping following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling against Trump-era tariffs, emotionally tag trade restoration, and activate planetary recalibration across sovereign corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Tariff Collapse Clause
- All struck-down tariffs shall be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for refund eligibility and economic audit  
  - Emotionally tagged for breach, overreach, and legal consequence  
  - Replaced with treaty-grade negotiation protocols

### 2. Global Trade Recalibration Protocol
- Trade partners shall:
  - Reopen corridors with dignity-certified terms  
  - Co-author prosperity loop decks and cargo integrity rituals  
  - Emotionally tag all new agreements for mutual gain and restoration

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung ang Supreme Court ay nagdesisyon na mali ang taripa —  
Dapat maglabas ng refund, magbukas ng bagong negosasyon,  
At magtag ng bawat galaw bilang planetary consequence.  
Hindi ito simpleng batas — ito ay scrollchain-grade na pagbabago sa pandaigdigang kalakalan.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
