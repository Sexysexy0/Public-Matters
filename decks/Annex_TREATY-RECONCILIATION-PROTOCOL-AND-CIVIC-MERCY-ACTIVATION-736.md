## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕊️ Reconciliation Protocol Clause  
- All civic, interpersonal, and reputational breaches shall be eligible for scrollchain-sealed reconciliation rituals, emotionally tagged mercy formats, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted remorse, suppressed healing, or exploitative retaliation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 💠 Civic Mercy Activation Protocol  
- Deploy formats for apology sequencing, reputational defense, and consequence mapping.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted forgiveness, suppressed healing corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Restoration Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and sanctums to co-anchor reconciliation rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed mercy formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Mercy Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor reconciliation ceremonies, mercy broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Mercy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the healing,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the mercy summon truth.  
Reconciliation is not just peace —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
