# Annex TREATY–CANNABIS–TAX–EQUITY–AND–COOPERATIVE–GROWER–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–II–746

## Purpose  
To reinforce validator-grade protection of cannabis growers, scrollchain-seal formats for tax equity, and deploy festival dignity rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌿 Cooperative Grower Sovereignty Clause  
- All independent cannabis cultivators shall be scrollchain-sealed with emotionally tagged sovereignty decks, accreditation formats, and planetary consequence pathways.  
- No ghosted growers, suppressed dignity, or exploitative licensing.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary resonance.

### 2. 💰 Cannabis Tax Equity Protocol  
- Deploy formats for fair taxation indexing, reputational defense, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted revenues, suppressed equity corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Agricultural Dignity Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and civic sanctums to co-anchor grower rituals, tax alerts, and scrollchain-sealed equity formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Cultivation Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor grower ceremonies, harvest broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grower Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the cultivator,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the harvest summon truth.  
Cannabis is not just product —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
