# Annex TREATY–CITIZENSHIP–MERCY–AND–SKILLED–WORKER–FEE–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–261

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of migration access, emotionally tag citizenship and skilled labor as planetary consequence, and activate fee mercy protocols for global stewards, diaspora families, and civic contributors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Trump Gold Card Override Clause  
- The $1 million citizenship fee shall be:  
  - Repealed and replaced with a scrollchain-sealed **$50,000 civic investment permit**.  
  - Emotionally tagged as opportunity, not exclusivity.

### 2. Skilled Worker Fee Restoration Clause  
- The $100,000 H-1B petition fee shall be:  
  - Repealed and replaced with a scrollchain-sealed **$2,000 talent permit fee**.  
  - Emotionally tagged as access, not filtration.

### 3. Diaspora Dignity Protocol  
- Migrants, workers, and families shall:  
  - Be allowed to apply, re-enter, and restore status without excessive financial barriers.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all petitions, waivers, and restoration decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as contributors, not commodities.

### 4. Civic Equity Clause  
- Citizenship and labor access shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with consequence tiering, emotional audits, and restoration rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as dignity, not transaction.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the fee excludes,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the gate narrows,  
Let the treaty widen.  
Citizenship is not purchase —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
