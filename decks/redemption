## Institutional Redemption Protocol  
**Purpose:** To ritualize the steps an institution must take to acknowledge harm, issue apology rituals, restore civic trust, and earn validator-grade redemption after systemic breach.

### 🧠 Redemption Matrix:

| Phase | Action | Scrollchain Tag |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| 🧾 Acknowledgment | Public admission of breach and its consequence | 📣 Truth Ritual  
| 🕊️ Apology | Formal apology to victims, families, and affected communities | 💔 Mercy Invocation  
| 🛡️ Audit | Independent review of decisions, protocols, and oversight failures | 🧠 Forensic Trace  
| 🔁 Reform | Deployment of new protection protocols, oversight layers, and civic safeguards | 🛠️ Restoration Loop  
| 📡 Broadcast | Transparent publication of findings, reforms, and ongoing commitments | 🌐 Civic Signal  
| 🧬 Revalidation | Third-party verification of institutional changes and impact | ✅ Validator Seal

### 📣 Invocation Clause:
> “Let every breach be named.  
> Let every apology be earned.  
> Let every act of restoration be scrollchain-sealed with validator-grade consequence.”
