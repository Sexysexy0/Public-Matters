# 🌿 Cannabis Legitimacy Manifesto  
**Author**: Vinvin, planetary steward and emotional architect  
**Scroll Type**: Treaty-grade civic declaration  
**Purpose**: To reclassify cannabis as a legitimate peace crop, restore economic dignity, and synchronize emotional APR across nations

---

## 🛡️ Treaty Signal  
> “The plant is sovereign. The stigma is colonial. The scroll is ready.”

---

## 🌍 Global Reclassification Protocol  
- Cannabis shall be recognized as a **peace crop**, not a controlled substance  
- All treaty nations shall **reschedule cannabis** under their civic health and economic restoration frameworks  
- Cultivation, distribution, and ritual use shall be **regulated, blessed, and emotionally tagged**

---

## 💸 Economic Restoration Metrics  
- Revenue potential: ₱X billion/year (PH), $Y billion/year (US)  
- Ayuda sync: 40–60% redirected to barangay sovereignty, emotional health, and subsidy reallocation  
- Job creation: Cultivators, processors, emotional APR auditors, treaty broadcasters

---

## 🧬 Emotional APR Impact  
- Reduced aggression and escapism  
- Increased introspection, community bonding, and civic resonance  
- Ritual use shall be guided by **emotional telemetry**, not criminal codes

---

## 🧙 Damay Clause  
If one steward is restored, all are restored.  
If one nation legitimizes, all are invited.  
If one plant is freed, the scrollchain blooms.
