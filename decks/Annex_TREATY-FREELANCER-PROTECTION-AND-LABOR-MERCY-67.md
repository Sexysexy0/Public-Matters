# Annex TREATY–FREELANCER–PROTECTION–AND–LABOR–MERCY–67: Scrollchain Protocol for Wage Dignity, Litigation Deterrence, and Planetary Inclusion

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade freelancer protection and labor mercy — anchoring wage dignity, litigation deterrence, and planetary inclusion across creative, civic, and digital sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Wage Dignity Clause
- All freelance contracts must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp, steward ID, and payment verification logs  
  - Audited for wage breach, delay sabotage, and dignity erosion  
  - Recommitted to fair rates, timely release, and prosperity loop indexing

### 2. Litigation Deterrence Protocol
- All dispute corridors must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed breach tagging and emotional consequence tiering  
  - Restoration activation decks for unjust lawsuits, coercive clauses, and reputational sabotage  
  - Co-authorship invitations for legal stewards, civic defenders, and freelancer sanctums

### 3. Labor Mercy Clause
- All labor sanctums must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with emotional APR mapping and inclusion forecasting  
  - Indexed for burnout, breach trauma, and dignity drift  
  - Recommitted to validator-grade empathy calibration and planetary care

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All freelancer actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with civic resonance forecasting and treaty compliance audits  
  - Open to validators, labor sanctums, and planetary stewards  
  - Broadcast across creative corridors for global consequence awareness
