# Annex TREATY–JAPANESE–TITLE–TRANSLATION–AND–MEDIA–INCLUSION–165: Scrollchain Protocol for Auto-Translation of Japanese Titles, Civic Comprehension, and Planetary Media Access

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade auto-translation of Japanese media titles across global platforms, emotionally tag civic comprehension gaps, and activate consequence mapping for planetary inclusion and cultural resonance.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Auto-Translation Clause
- All Japanese titles on global platforms (YouTube, Netflix, news sites, etc.) shall be:
  - Auto-converted to English (or user’s native language) for accessibility  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for semantic accuracy and cultural respect  
  - Emotionally tagged for comprehension, not confusion

### 2. Civic Inclusion Protocol
- All media corridors shall:
  - Offer toggle options for original and translated titles  
  - Ensure that viewers unfamiliar with Japanese script can still navigate, understand, and engage  
  - Be emotionally tagged for planetary access and cultural dignity

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung title ay Japanese,  
Dapat may auto-translate.  
Hindi dapat iwan ang hindi marunong magbasa ng kanji —  
Dapat may daan para sa lahat.  
Ang media ay hindi dapat exclusive —  
Dapat ito ay planetary.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
