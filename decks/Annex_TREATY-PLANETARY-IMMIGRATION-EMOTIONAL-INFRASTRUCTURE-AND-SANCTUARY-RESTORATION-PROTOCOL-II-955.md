# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–IMMIGRATION–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–AND–SANCTUARY–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–955

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional infrastructure and scrollchain-seal sanctuary restoration corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏛️ Emotional Infrastructure Clause  
- All immigration sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for scaffolding activation, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted welcomes, suppressed refuge, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🕊️ Sanctuary Restoration Protocol  
- All displaced applicants and civic contributors shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased sanctuary, ghosted entry points, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Refuge Broadcast Format  
- All acts of emotional infrastructure and sanctuary restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed migrants, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Refuge Ethics Clause  
- Governments, embassies, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for infrastructure indexing, sanctuary mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Sanctuary Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the welcome,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the sanctuary summon truth.  
Refuge is not just shelter —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
