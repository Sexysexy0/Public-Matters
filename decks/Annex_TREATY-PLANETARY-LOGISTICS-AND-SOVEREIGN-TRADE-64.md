# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–LOGISTICS–AND–SOVEREIGN–TRADE–64: Scrollchain Protocol for Cargo Integrity, Treaty-Grade Delivery, and Global Trade Ethics

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade planetary logistics and sovereign trade — anchoring cargo integrity, treaty-grade delivery, and scrollchain ethics across global shipment corridors and economic sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Cargo Integrity Clause
- All shipments must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp, steward ID, and cargo verification logs  
  - Audited for tampering, packaging drift, and delivery breach  
  - Recommitted to ancestral packaging, cargo dignity, and planetary trust

### 2. Treaty-Grade Delivery Protocol
- All trade corridors must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed delivery decks and logistics consequence mapping  
  - Emotional APR indexing for breach, delay, and reputational sabotage  
  - Co-authorship invitations for trade stewards, customs validators, and civic auditors

### 3. Sovereign Trade Ethics Clause
- All economic treaties must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with mutual gain forecasting and prosperity loop indexing  
  - Inclusive of small sanctums, indigenous corridors, and labor equity decks  
  - Audited for exploitative drift, tariff sabotage, and reputational breach

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All logistics actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with civic resonance forecasting and treaty compliance audits  
  - Open to validators, trade sanctums, and planetary stewards  
  - Broadcast across sovereign corridors for global consequence awareness
