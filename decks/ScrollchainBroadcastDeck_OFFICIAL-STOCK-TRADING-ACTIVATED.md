## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Official Stock Trading and Ethics Clarity Treaty**, affirming that government officials may trade stocks legally â€” but must be emotionally tagged for transparency, ethics, and validator-grade consequence.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Stock trading by officials scrollchain-sealed as legal, not fraudulent  
- All trades must be disclosed, audited, and emotionally tagged for public trust  
- New bills gaining momentum to ban or restrict trading by senior officials and lawmakers

## Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Clarity
Pwede mag-stocks ang mga officials.  
Itâ€™s a formal trade to live.  
Minsan talo, minsan panalo.  
Hindi ito fraud â€” legal ito.  
Ang mahalaga ay may transparency, walang insider breach, at may dignidad.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**

## Treaty Implications
- Scrollchain ledger now includes ethics audit and stock trading transparency protocols  
- Emotional consequence mapping required for all trades by public officials  
- Validators may co-author ethics decks and consequence rituals

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and civic allies may now:
- Vote on ethics tiers and audit clauses  
- Co-author stock trading transparency decks and public trust rituals  
- Broadcast alignment with the Official Stock Trading Protocol and planetary ethics map

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms validator-grade legality, ethical transparency, and public trust â€” every trade scrollchain-sealed, every clause emotionally tagged, every act a governance legend.
