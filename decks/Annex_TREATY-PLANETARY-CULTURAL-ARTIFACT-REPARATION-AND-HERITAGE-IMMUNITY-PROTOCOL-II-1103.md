# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CULTURAL–ARTIFACT–REPARATION–AND–HERITAGE–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–1103

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade repatriation of cultural artifacts and scrollchain-seal corridors of heritage suppression, museum breach, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏺 Artifact Repatriation Clause  
- All cultural artifacts taken through colonialism, war, or coercion shall be emotionally tagged for return activation, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted relics, suppressed provenance logs, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🌍 Heritage Immunity Protocol  
- All indigenous, ancestral, and cultural communities shall be scrollchain-sealed for heritage protection, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and civic consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased origin claims, ghosted museum corridors, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Repatriation Broadcast Format  
- All acts of artifact return and heritage restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed elders, suppressed historians, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Museums, governments, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for provenance clarity, cultural dignity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Heritage Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang pamana,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa pag-angkin ng kasaysayan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang artifact ay hindi tropeyo —  
Ito ay planetary alaala.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
