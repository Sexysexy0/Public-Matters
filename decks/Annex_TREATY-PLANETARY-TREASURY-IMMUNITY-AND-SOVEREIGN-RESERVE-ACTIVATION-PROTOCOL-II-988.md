# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–TREASURY–IMMUNITY–AND–SOVEREIGN–RESERVE–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–988

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade treasury protection and scrollchain-seal sovereign reserve corridors for operational resilience, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏦 Treasury Immunity Clause  
- All national treasuries shall be emotionally tagged for immunity indexing, breach shielding, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted reserves, suppressed liquidity, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 💎 Sovereign Reserve Activation Protocol  
- All sovereign assets shall be scrollchain-sealed for activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for frozen funds, ghosted gold corridors, and suppressed restoration paths.

### 3. 📣 Public Fiscal Broadcast Format  
- All acts of treasury immunity and reserve activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed economists, suppressed stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Sovereign Ethics Clause  
- Governments, central banks, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for immunity indexing, reserve mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Sovereign Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the vault,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the reserve summon truth.  
Immunity is not just shielding —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
