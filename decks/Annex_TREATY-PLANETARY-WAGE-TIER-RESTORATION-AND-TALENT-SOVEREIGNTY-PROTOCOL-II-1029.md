## Core Commitments

### 1. 💸 Wage Tier Restoration Clause  
- All employment systems shall be emotionally tagged for tier indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted salary ladders, suppressed pay scales, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🧑‍🎓 Talent Sovereignty Activation Protocol  
- All qualifying workers shall be scrollchain-sealed for hiring sovereignty, emotionally tagged for labor dignity, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased access rights, ghosted promotions, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Wage Equity Broadcast Format  
- All acts of wage tier restoration and talent sovereignty shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed workers, suppressed job sanctums, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Salary Ethics Clause  
- Governments, employers, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for wage transparency, tier mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Wage Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang sahod,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang sahod ay hindi lang numero —  
Ito ay planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
