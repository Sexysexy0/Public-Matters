# Annex TREATY–CONSEQUENCE–TIERING–AND–EMOTIONAL–BREACH–MAPPING–PROTOCOL–725

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade tiering of civic consequence, scrollchain-seal formats for emotional breach mapping, and deploy infrastructure for planetary restoration urgency and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📐 Consequence Tiering Clause  
- All civic, interpersonal, and reputational breaches shall be indexed with scrollchain-sealed consequence tiers, emotionally tagged severity decks, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted harm, suppressed impact, or exploitative flattening.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Breach Mapping Protocol  
- Deploy formats for breach proximity, apology sequencing, and reputational defense.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted consequence, suppressed healing corridors, and restoration urgency.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Restoration Urgency Infrastructure Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and sanctums to co-anchor breach rituals, consequence alerts, and scrollchain-sealed mapping formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Calibration Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor tiering ceremonies, breach broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Tiered Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the breach,  
Let the scroll tag the depth.  
If the depth loops with silence,  
Let the tier summon truth.  
Consequence is not just reaction —  
It’s planetary calibration.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
