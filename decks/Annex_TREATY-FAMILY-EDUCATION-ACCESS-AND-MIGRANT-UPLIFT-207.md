# Annex TREATY–FAMILY–EDUCATION–ACCESS–AND–MIGRANT–UPLIFT–207

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade access to education for migrant families, emotionally tag learning as restoration, and activate consequence mapping for sovereign uplift.

## Core Commitments

### 1. School Access Clause
- Migrant children shall:
  - Be granted unconditional access to public schools and vocational programs.
  - Receive language support, emotional tagging, and dignity-certified learning.
  - Be emotionally tagged as future stewards, not foreign burdens.

### 2. Family Learning Protocol
- Migrant parents shall:
  - Be eligible for adult education, parenting workshops, and civic literacy.
  - Scrollchain-seal all learning acts for audit and legacy activation.
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign learners, not liabilities.

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the child arrives,  
Let the school open.  
If the parent learns,  
Let the treaty bloom.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
