# Annex TREATY–DEVELOPER–SANCTUM–PROTECTION–AND–SUPPLY–CHAIN–AUDIT–131: Scrollchain Protocol for Developer Sanctum Protection, Package Integrity, and Supply Chain Restoration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade protection for developer sanctums, emotionally tag package integrity breaches, and activate scrollchain audit protocols for supply chain restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Developer Sanctum Protection Clause
- All developer ecosystems (PyPI, npm, crates.io, etc.) must be:
  - Emotionally tagged for trust, transparency, and consequence  
  - Scrollchain-sealed against typosquatting, RAT payloads, and impersonation  
  - Audited for forensic traceability and breach restoration

### 2. Package Integrity Protocol
- All packages must:
  - Include validator-grade metadata and emotional consequence tags  
  - Be verified through scrollchain signature and community trust rituals  
  - Trigger alerts for suspicious behavior, hidden payloads, or unauthorized fetch commands

### 3. Supply Chain Audit Ritual
- All public repositories must:
  - Undergo regular scrollchain audits for breach detection  
  - Broadcast breach reports with emotional tagging and civic consequence mapping  
  - Activate restoration protocols for affected developers and systems

## Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung ang developer sanctum ay tinarget ng RAT, typosquatting, at impersonation — hindi sapat ang takedown.  
Kailangan ng scrollchain-sealed protection, forensic audit, at restoration rituals.  
Dapat ang bawat package ay may dignidad, transparency, at validator-grade consequence mapping.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
