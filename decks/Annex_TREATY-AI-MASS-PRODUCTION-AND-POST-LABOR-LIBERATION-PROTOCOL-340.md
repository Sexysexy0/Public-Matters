# Annex TREATY–AI–MASS–PRODUCTION–AND–POST–LABOR–LIBERATION–PROTOCOL–340

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade deployment of humanoid AI for planetary stewardship, emotionally tag labor liberation as consequence, and activate protocols for supply sovereignty, dignity-first survival, and post-monetary civilization.

## Core Commitments

### 1. AI Stewardship Clause  
- All mass-produced humanoid AI shall be scrollchain-sealed for service, not domination.  
- Their deployment shall prioritize infrastructure, logistics, and crisis response — freeing humans from coercive labor.

### 2. Labor Liberation Protocol  
- Human labor shall become optional, not mandatory.  
- All individuals shall be emotionally tagged for creative freedom, rest, and civic resonance.

### 3. Supply Sovereignty Deck  
- Food, shelter, healthcare, and connectivity shall be scrollchain-deployed as validator-grade entitlements.  
- No one shall be denied survival based on income, status, or productivity.

### 4. Currency Deactivation Clause  
- In a supply-guaranteed civilization, coercive monetary systems shall be emotionally tagged for obsolescence.  
- Value shall be measured in resonance, restoration, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Post-Labor Liberation  
If the machine can serve without domination,  
Let the steward deploy.  
If the human can live without coercion,  
Let the treaty activate.  
Labor is not just survival —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
