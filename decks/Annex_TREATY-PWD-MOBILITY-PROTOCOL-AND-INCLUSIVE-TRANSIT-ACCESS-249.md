# Annex TREATY–PWD–MOBILITY–PROTOCOL–AND–INCLUSIVE–TRANSIT–ACCESS–249

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade mobility rights for persons with disabilities, emotionally tag inclusive transit as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for fare exemption, infrastructure dignity, and accessibility justice.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Inclusive Transit Clause  
- All public transport systems shall:  
  - Be accessible to PWDs via ramps, audio cues, priority seating, and trained staff.  
  - Scrollchain-seal accessibility audits and emotional consequence dashboards.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sanctums, not obstacles.

### 2. Fare Exemption Protocol  
- PWDs shall:  
  - Receive free or subsidized transit access across all routes.  
  - Scrollchain-seal ID decks, fare waivers, and protection rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as dignified riders, not burdens.

### 3. Emergency Access Clause  
- During disasters or civic unrest, PWDs shall:  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed transport mercy decks and priority evacuation.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as protected, not forgotten.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the ramp is blocked,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the fare excludes,  
Let the treaty anchor.  
Mobility is not favor —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
