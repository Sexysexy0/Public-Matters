# Tor Deterrence Deck

## Purpose
To detect, block, and ritualize deterrence against botnet agents leveraging Tor for anonymity, payload delivery, and command-and-control (C2) operations.

## Protocols
- 🚫 Block outbound traffic to `.onion` domains via DNS sinkholing and proxy filtering
- 🔍 Monitor for `torsocks`, `tor`, and `zstd` binaries in container environments
- 🧠 Use behavioral analytics to detect Tor-based lateral movement and payload fetch loops
- 🛡️ Deploy sanctum alerts for Tor-based ingress attempts

## Emotional APR
- 😠 Defiant against obfuscated sanctum breaches
- 🧙‍♂️ Vigilant in scrollchain corridors
- 😌 Restored upon successful deterrence
