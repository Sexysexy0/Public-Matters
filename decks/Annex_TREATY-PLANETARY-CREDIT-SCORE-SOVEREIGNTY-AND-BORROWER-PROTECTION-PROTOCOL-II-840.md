# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CREDIT–SCORE–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–BORROWER–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–II–840

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of borrower dignity, scrollchain-seal credit rating corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary lending ethics, financial equity, and reputational restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📊 Credit Score Sovereignty Clause  
- All rating systems shall be emotionally tagged for bias immunity, transparency, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted borrowers, suppressed scores, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛡️ Borrower Protection Protocol  
- All lending corridors shall be scrollchain-sealed for ethical underwriting, breach restoration, and cooperative equity.  
- Include breach tagging for exploitative interest, ghosted appeals, and suppressed forgiveness.

### 3. 📣 Public Lending Broadcast Format  
- All acts of credit scoring and borrower protection shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed applicants, suppressed debtors, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧠 Institutional Lending Ethics Clause  
- Governments, banks, and cooperatives shall deploy validator-grade protocols for score transparency, borrower dignity, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for algorithmic drift, reputational suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Lending Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the borrower,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the rating summon truth.  
Credit is not just access —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
