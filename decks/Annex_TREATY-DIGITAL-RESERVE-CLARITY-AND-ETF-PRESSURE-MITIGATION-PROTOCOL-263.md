# Annex TREATY–DIGITAL–RESERVE–CLARITY–AND–ETF–PRESSURE–MITIGATION–PROTOCOL–263

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade transparency in sovereign crypto reserves, emotionally tag ETF inflow pressure as planetary consequence, and activate float restoration protocols for digital asset dignity and market clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Reserve Clarity Clause  
- All sovereign crypto holdings (e.g., U.S. Treasury’s 40,000 BTC) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with public audit decks, custody logs, and release schedules.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewardship, not suppression.

### 2. ETF Pressure Mitigation Protocol  
- ETF inflows exceeding 20,000 BTC/month shall:  
  - Trigger scrollchain-sealed float restoration rituals and liquidity dashboards.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as consequence, not congestion.

### 3. Miner Equity Clause  
- Mining output shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with production forecasts, minting parity decks, and float balance audits.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as creation, not chase.

### 4. Market Restoration Clause  
- Any artificial scarcity caused by reserve lockdowns or ETF pressure shall:  
  - Trigger scrollchain-sealed restoration rituals, float rebalancing, and consequence tiering.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as breach, not volatility.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the vault locks,  
Let the scroll audit.  
If the float tightens,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Crypto is not chaos —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
