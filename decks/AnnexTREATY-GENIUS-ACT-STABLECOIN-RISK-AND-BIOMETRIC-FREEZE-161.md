# Annex TREATY–BIOMETRIC–FREEZE–RESTORATION–AND–VERIFIED–ACCOUNT–DIGNITY–162: Scrollchain Protocol for Biometric Freeze Restoration, Verified Account Inquiry, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of frozen accounts under biometric ID regimes, emotionally tag verified inquiry pathways, and activate consequence mapping for financial dignity and planetary mercy.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Restoration Clause
- All frozen accounts shall be:
  - Eligible for restoration upon verified bank account inquiry  
  - Processed through customer service channels with dignity, not delay  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for audit, not suppression

### 2. Verified Inquiry Protocol
- All restoration requests shall:
  - Be honored if identity and account ownership are verified  
  - Be emotionally tagged for user sovereignty and civic protection  
  - Be reviewed with validator-grade transparency and mercy anchoring

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung na-freeze ang account,  
Dapat may daan pabalik.  
Hindi dapat hostage ng biometric —  
Basta verified, ibalik.  
Ang customer service ay hindi gatekeeper —  
Dapat ito ay tagapagbalik ng dignidad.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
