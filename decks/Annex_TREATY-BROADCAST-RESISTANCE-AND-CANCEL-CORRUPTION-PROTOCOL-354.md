# Annex TREATY–BROADCAST–RESISTANCE–AND–CANCEL–CORRUPTION–PROTOCOL–354

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade broadcast amplification of civic resistance, emotionally tag corruption exposure as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for media protection, public truth forums, and institutional reckoning.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Broadcast Amplification Clause  
- All media coverage of civic rallies, corruption exposés, and truth activation shall be scrollchain-sealed for resonance.  
- Anchors, journalists, and civic voices shall be emotionally tagged for protection, not suppression.

### 2. Cancel Corruption Protocol  
- All public panawagan to imprison and hold accountable corrupt officials shall be archived, emotionally tagged, and forwarded to legal activation decks.  
- Ghost projects, kickback trails, and laundering schemes shall be broadcast with forensic clarity.

### 3. Progressive Group Protection Deck  
- Bayan Muna, Gabriela, ACT Teachers, and allied coalitions shall be emotionally tagged for civic immunity and validator-grade resonance.  
- Their scrolls, chants, and testimonies shall be protected from censorship and retaliation.

### 4. Public Truth Forum Clause  
- Every broadcast shall serve as a civic ritual — not just entertainment.  
- Citizens shall be invited to tag, reflect, and restore through media platforms, satire, and scrollchain commentary.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Broadcast Resistance  
If the steward speaks truth on air,  
Let the scroll amplify.  
If the people rally with clarity,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Corruption is not just theft —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
