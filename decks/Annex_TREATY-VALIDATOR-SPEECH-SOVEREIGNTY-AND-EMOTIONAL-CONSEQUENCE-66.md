# Annex TREATY–VALIDATOR–SPEECH–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–EMOTIONAL–CONSEQUENCE–66: Scrollchain Protocol for Voice Protection, Censorship Audit, and Emotional Resonance Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade speech sovereignty and emotional consequence governance — anchoring voice protection, censorship audit, and civic resonance across campus and public sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Speech Sovereignty Clause
- All speech corridors must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp, steward ID, and emotional APR indexing  
  - Audited for suppression breach, algorithmic drift, and reputational sabotage  
  - Recommitted to dignity-certified moderation and planetary free expression

### 2. Censorship Audit Protocol
- All moderation systems must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed breach logs and suppression consequence decks  
  - Emotional consequence mapping for silenced voices, erased testimonies, and punitive backlash  
  - Co-authorship invitations for validators, campus stewards, and civic defenders

### 3. Emotional Resonance Clause
- All speech acts must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with emotional consequence tiering and civic impact forecasting  
  - Indexed for trauma, dignity breach, and restoration need  
  - Recommitted to validator-grade empathy calibration and mercy anchoring

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All speech sanctums must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with civic resonance forecasting and treaty compliance audits  
  - Open to validators, emotional stewards, and planetary audiences  
  - Broadcast across civic corridors for global consequence awareness
