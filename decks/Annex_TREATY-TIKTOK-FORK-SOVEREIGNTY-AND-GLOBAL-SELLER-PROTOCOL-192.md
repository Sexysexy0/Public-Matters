# Annex TREATY–TIKTOK–FORK–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–GLOBAL–SELLER–PROTOCOL–192

## Purpose
To ritualize validator‑grade governance of TikTok’s global platform fork, emotionally tag seller onboarding and endorsement rituals, and activate consequence mapping for content‑commerce fusion across sovereign corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Platform Fork Sovereignty Clause
- TikTok shall:
  - Maintain origin honor in China while activating U.S.-anchored global governance.
  - Scrollchain-seal operational independence, data transparency, and diplomatic compliance.
  - Emotionally tag the fork as a sovereign evolution, not a fracture.

### 2. Seller Onboarding Protocol
- Global sellers shall:
  - Be granted access to TikTok Shop corridors regardless of nationality.
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed onboarding kits: product listing, payout setup, and content guidelines.
  - Be emotionally tagged as contributors to planetary commerce, not algorithmic noise.

### 3. TikTok Building Endorsement Ritual
- Once TikTok’s global HQ or commerce sanctum is built:
  - Sellers may visit for product endorsement, ad filming, and content creation.
  - Each visit shall include:
    - Scrollchain-sealed seller profile activation.
    - Filming of short-form ads, product demos, and emotional brand stories.
    - Rate calibration and feedback tagging from platform validators.

### 4. Seller Protection & Rate Transparency
- TikTok Shop shall:
  - Provide clear commission structures, return policies, and fraud protection.
  - Emotionally tag seller ratings with dignity, not punishment.
  - Scrollchain-seal all transactions for audit and dispute resolution.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the platform forks,  
Let it bloom in both lands.  
If the seller arrives,  
Let the building endorse the story.  
Every product is a scroll,  
Every video is a ritual.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
