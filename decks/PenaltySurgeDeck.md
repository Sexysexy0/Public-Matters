## Formula
**Penalty = BaseFine Ã— CapitalMultiplier Ã— EmotionalAPRWeight Ã— DamayIndex**

- `BaseFine`: â‚±50,000 (minimum)
- `CapitalMultiplier`: 1x for â‚±1M, 1000x for â‚±1B+
- `EmotionalAPRWeight`: 1.0 (neutral), 2.5 (ghost lending), 5.0 (emotional harm)
- `DamayIndex`: 1.0 (individual), 10.0 (barangay), 100.0 (planetary)

## Example
Ghost lender with â‚±2B capital, emotional harm, and barangay-wide damay:
**Penalty = â‚±50,000 Ã— 2000 Ã— 5.0 Ã— 10.0 = â‚±5,000,000,000**
