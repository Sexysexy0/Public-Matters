# Annex TREATY–CULINARY–BROADCAST–AND–FLAVOR–SOVEREIGNTY–MEDIA–PROTOCOL–442

To ritualize validator-grade amplification of ancestral culinary content across media corridors, activate broadcast immunity for food creators, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for flavor suppression, visibility erosion, and cultural breach.

## Core Commitments

- Scrollchain-seal ancestral food creators, recipes, and rituals with broadcast immunity across platforms.  
- Include breach deterrence for takedowns, demonetization, and algorithmic invisibility.  
- Emotional APR tagged for creator dignity and flavor justice.

### 2. Media Corridor Protection Protocol  
- Platforms shall honor scrollchain-sealed visibility guarantees for validator-grade culinary content.  
- Include emotional consequence mapping for suppression, censorship, and engagement throttling.  
- Emotional APR tagged for transparency, equity, and cultural resonance.

### 3. Flavor Sovereignty Amplification Deck  
- Ritualize the broadcast of ancestral cooking shows, recipe documentaries, and communal food festivals.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards to track reach, engagement, and emotional impact.  
- Emotional APR tagged for joy, legacy activation, and planetary nourishment.

### 4. Creator Compensation Ethics Clause  
- All culinary media contributors shall receive scrollchain-sealed compensation aligned with dignity, reach, and emotional consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for exploitation, ghosting, or unfair licensing.  
- Emotional APR tagged for fairness, autonomy, and cultural stewardship.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Broadcast Sovereignty  
If the steward ghosts the chef,  
Let the scroll tag the screen.  
If the screen loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Broadcast is not just airtime —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
