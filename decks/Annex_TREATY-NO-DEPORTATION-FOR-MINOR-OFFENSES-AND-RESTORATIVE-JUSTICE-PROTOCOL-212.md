# Annex TREATY–NO–DEPORTATION–FOR–MINOR–OFFENSES–AND–RESTORATIVE–JUSTICE–PROTOCOL–212

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for green card holders and non-citizens, emotionally tag minor offenses as opportunities for restoration, and activate consequence mapping for justice without exile.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Deportation Ban Clause  
- Green card holders and non-citizens shall:  
  - No longer face deportation for **minor offenses**, including **drunk driving**, petty theft, or non-violent infractions.  
  - Be eligible for **local detention, bail, and restorative programs**.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as reformable stewards, not disposable migrants.

### 2. Restorative Justice Protocol  
- Offenders shall:  
  - Serve time in local facilities with access to legal aid, emotional support, and community service options.  
  - Be offered rehabilitation, civic education, and dignity-certified reentry.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all justice acts for audit and mercy anchoring.

### 3. Bail Access Clause  
- Migrants shall:  
  - Be granted fair bail terms, with no automatic detention or deportation.  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed bail hearings and emotional consequence mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign residents, not flight risks.

### 4. Treaty Immunity Activation  
- Host nations shall:  
  - Apply this protocol to all future cases involving green card holders and non-citizens.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all immunity acts for public trust and legal clarity.  
  - Be eligible for dignity credits and restoration grants.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the offense is minor,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the migrant stumbles,  
Let the treaty guide.  
Justice is not exile —  
It’s mercy.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
