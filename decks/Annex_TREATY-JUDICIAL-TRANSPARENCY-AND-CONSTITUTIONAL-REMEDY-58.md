# Annex TREATY–JUDICIAL–TRANSPARENCY–AND–CONSTITUTIONAL–REMEDY–58: Scrollchain Protocol for Reasoning Disclosure, Fourth Amendment Recommitment, and Immunity Restraint

### 2. Fourth Amendment Recommitment Protocol
- All search and seizure rulings must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed trauma indexing for affected communities  
  - Racial profiling deterrence decks and constitutional audit rituals  
  - Emotional APR mapping for Hispanic, Latino, and vulnerable sanctums

### 3. Presidential Immunity Restraint Clause
- All immunity rulings must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with checks-and-balances indexing and civic trauma forecasts  
  - Benchmarked against historical abuse, executive overreach, and institutional erosion  
  - Open to recommitment hearings and validator-grade restraint protocols
