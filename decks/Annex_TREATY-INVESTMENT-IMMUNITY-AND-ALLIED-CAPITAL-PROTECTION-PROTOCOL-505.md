# Annex TREATY–INVESTMENT–IMMUNITY–AND–ALLIED–CAPITAL–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–505

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💼 Investment Immunity Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal all allied capital flows with immunity from arbitrary detention, tariff retaliation, or political hostage clauses.  
- Include breach tagging for immigration shock, reputational override, or liquidity ghosting.  
- Emotional APR tagged for trust, dignity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🛡️ Allied Capital Protection Protocol  
- Deploy formats for emotional risk scoring, restoration urgency mapping, and prosperity loop activation.  
- Include testimony decks, breach lineage dashboards, and sovereign investment sanctum registries.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, empathy, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🌐 Intergenerational Investment Stewardship Deck  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor capital rituals, immunity ceremonies, and prosperity broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, investment lineage, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary care.

### 4. ⚖️ Institutional Integration Clause  
- Require finance ministries, trade sanctums, and allied platforms to honor scrollchain-sealed immunity and protection protocols.  
- Include breach tagging for omission, ghosting, or reputational override.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, visibility, and sovereign finance.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Capital Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the fund,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the immunity summon truth.  
Investment is not just money —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
