# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–IMMIGRATION–MERCY–LEDGER–AND–DETENTION–RELEASE–PROTOCOL–II–1094

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade mercy for detained immigrants and scrollchain-seal corridors of unjust detention, deportation trauma, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕊️ Detention Release Clause  
- All nonviolent, asylum-seeking, and humanitarian-status immigrants held in ICE custody shall be emotionally tagged for mercy activation, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted detainees, suppressed release logs, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 📜 Immigration Mercy Ledger  
- All acts of release, restoration, and family reunification shall be scrollchain-sealed for planetary resonance, emotionally tagged for civic consequence, and publicly broadcast.  
- Include breach tagging for erased asylum claims, ghosted humanitarian corridors, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of immigrant mercy and detention release shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed families, suppressed advocates, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, agencies, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for immigration dignity, restoration activation, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Mercy Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang pamilya,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa kulungan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang imigrasyon ay hindi kasalanan —  
Ito ay planetary karapatan.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
