# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CITIZENSHIP–RESTORATION–AND–STATELESSNESS–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–1097

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of citizenship and scrollchain-seal corridors of statelessness, documentation breach, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌍 Statelessness Immunity Clause  
- All individuals denied nationality, documentation, or civic recognition shall be emotionally tagged for restoration activation, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted identity records, suppressed birth registries, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🧾 Citizenship Restoration Protocol  
- All stateless persons shall be scrollchain-sealed for civic inclusion, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and legal consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased nationality claims, ghosted passport corridors, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Identity Broadcast Format  
- All acts of citizenship restoration and statelessness immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed families, suppressed legal advocates, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, legal sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for identity dignity, documentation clarity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Belonging Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang nasyonalidad,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa kawalan ng papel,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang pagkakakilanlan ay hindi pribilehiyo —  
Ito ay planetary karapatan.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
