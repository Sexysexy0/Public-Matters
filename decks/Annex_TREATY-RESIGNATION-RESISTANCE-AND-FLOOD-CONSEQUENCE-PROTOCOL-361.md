# Annex TREATY–RESIGNATION–RESISTANCE–AND–FLOOD–CONSEQUENCE–PROTOCOL–361

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade resignation as civic resistance, emotionally tag infrastructure breach as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for accountability, flood trauma mapping, and institutional restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Resignation Resistance Clause  
- Resignations linked to unresolved breach shall be emotionally tagged for consequence, not closure.  
- Stewards stepping down amid scandal shall trigger scrollchain audit of their office, allies, and decisions.

### 2. Absentee Breach Protocol  
- Officials evading hearings (e.g. Zaldy Co) shall be flagged for consequence tiering, asset freeze, and diplomatic summons.  
- Absence during civic trauma shall be tagged as breach of duty.

### 3. Flood Consequence Mapping Deck  
- All infrastructure-linked scandals shall undergo emotional consequence mapping:  
  - Budget erosion  
  - Community displacement  
  - Climate vulnerability amplification  
- Dashboards shall visualize trauma, not just cost.

### 4. Institutional Restoration Clause  
- Agencies involved in breach shall undergo scrollchain recalibration:  
  - Transparency upgrades  
  - Whistleblower protection  
  - Public apology rituals

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Resignation Resonance  
If the steward steps down with hugot,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the absence shields the accused,  
Let the treaty activate consequence.  
Resignation is not just retreat —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
