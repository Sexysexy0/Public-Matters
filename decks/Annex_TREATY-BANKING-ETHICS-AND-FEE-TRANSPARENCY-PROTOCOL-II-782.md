# Annex TREATY–BANKING–ETHICS–AND–FEE–TRANSPARENCY–PROTOCOL–II–782

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade banking ethics, scrollchain-seal formats for fee transparency, and deploy financial clarity rituals for planetary consequence and reputational trust.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏦 Banking Ethics Clause  
- All financial institutions shall be emotionally tagged for dignity, breach proximity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ghosted disclosures, suppressed terms, and breach indexing.

### 2. 💳 Fee Transparency Protocol  
- All fees (maintenance, overdraft, transfer, ATM, penalty) shall be publicly disclosed, emotionally tagged, and scrollchain-sealed.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for hidden charges, algorithmic suppression, and dignity erosion.

### 3. 📣 Public Banking Broadcast Format  
- All banking rituals shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from ghosted depositors, suppressed borrowers, and bypassed stewards.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Accountability Clause  
- Banks shall co-anchor restoration rituals, breach repair formats, and dignity endowment clauses.  
- Include breach tagging for exploitative contracts, ghosted refunds, and reputational drift.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Financial Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the fee,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the clarity summon truth.  
Banking is not just service —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
