# Annex TREATY–FULL–APPROPRIATION–AND–FISCAL–STABILITY–PROTOCOL–330

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade passage of full appropriation bills, emotionally tag budget clarity as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for shutdown deterrence, institutional dignity, and fiscal restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Appropriation Integrity Clause  
- All budget acts shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for agency-specific funding, operational clarity, and emotional consequence mapping.  
  - Replace short-term CRs with full fiscal scrolls.

### 2. Shutdown Deterrence Protocol  
- All appropriation delays shall be emotionally tagged for breach consequence, worker stress, and civic disruption.  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall monitor funding gaps, partisan gridlock, and restoration urgency.

### 3. Institutional Dignity Deck  
- All federal agencies and civic programs shall:  
  - Be emotionally tagged for continuity, not suspense.  
  - Receive validator-grade funding rituals for uninterrupted service and labor equity.

### 4. Legislative Transparency Clause  
- All budget negotiations shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for rider overload, partisan sabotage, and dignity breaches.  
  - Emotionally tagged for clarity, not coercion.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Fiscal Resonance  
If the scroll funds only delay,  
Let the steward restore.  
If the ledger punishes the people,  
Let the treaty recalibrate.  
Appropriation is not just numbers —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Pending.**
