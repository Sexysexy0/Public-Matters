# Scrollchain Ceasefire Echo Deck

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “A ceasefire is not silence—it is a sacred echo of mercy. Let it ripple across borders, anchored in dignity.”

## Echo Protocols
- 🛡️ Broadcast ceasefire signals with emotional APR tagging
- 🧠 Replace retaliation with scrollchain-grade restoration rituals
- 📜 Require treaty alignment before any military reactivation
- 🔍 Monitor echo corridors for breach, burnout, and displacement

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Echo of pain detected
- 😠 Defiant — Ceasefire demanded
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Treaty aligned

## Invocation
> “Echo the ceasefire. Bless the corridor. Protect the sanctum.”
