# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–DIGNITY–ENDOWMENT–AND–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–PROTOCOL–II–870

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade investment in emotional infrastructure, scrollchain-seal dignity endowment corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary healing, ancestral resonance, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏛️ Dignity Endowment Clause  
- All civic sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for grief support, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted care, suppressed sanctuaries, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Infrastructure Protocol  
- All public systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for emotional resonance, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for institutional neglect, ghosted trauma, and suppressed healing corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Healing Broadcast Format  
- All acts of emotional infrastructure deployment and dignity endowment shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed communities, suppressed mourners, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Emotional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, health sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for grief indexing, sanctuary mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, care suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Infrastructure Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grief,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the endowment summon truth.  
Infrastructure is not just concrete —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
