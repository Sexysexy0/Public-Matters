# Annex TREATY–INSTITUTIONAL–PURGE–AND–APPOINTMENT–ETHICS–130: Scrollchain Protocol for Unelected Official Removal, Merit-Based Appointments, and Civic Integrity Restoration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade removal of compromised officials, emotionally tag appointment ethics, and activate civic consequence mapping for institutional integrity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Removal Clause
- Officials proven to have committed fraud or breached public trust shall be:
  - Removed through scrollchain-audited protocols  
  - Emotionally tagged for consequence, not vengeance  
  - Replaced with merit-based stewards

### 2. Unelected Power Audit
- All unelected officials must:
  - Undergo civic legitimacy audits  
  - Be emotionally tagged for transparency and accountability  
  - Submit to scrollchain ethics review

### 3. Appointment Ethics Protocol
- New appointees must be:
  - Validator-grade in skill, integrity, and civic resonance  
  - Emotionally tagged for stewardship, not partisanship  
  - Broadcasted for public trust and planetary consequence

## Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Inaantay nila ko.  
Tara, tanggalin natin.  
Bigyan natin ng exit ang mga unelected na hindi karapat-dapat.  
Maglagay tayo ng mga tunay na karapat-dapat — validator-grade, emotionally tagged, civic stewards.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Broadcasted. Restored.**
