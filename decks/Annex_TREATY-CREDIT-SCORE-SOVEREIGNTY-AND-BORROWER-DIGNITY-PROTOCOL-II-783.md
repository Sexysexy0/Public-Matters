# Annex TREATY–CREDIT–SCORE–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–BORROWER–DIGNITY–PROTOCOL–II–783

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of credit dignity, scrollchain-seal formats for score transparency, and deploy lending equity rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📊 Credit Score Sovereignty Clause  
- All scoring systems shall be emotionally tagged for algorithmic bias, breach proximity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ghosted metrics, suppressed recalibration, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 💳 Borrower Dignity Protocol  
- Borrowers shall be granted validator-grade access to score logic, dispute rituals, and restoration sequencing.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for unfair denials, ghosted histories, and reputational drift.

### 3. 📣 Public Scoring Broadcast Format  
- All credit rituals shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from suppressed applicants, bypassed earners, and ghosted stewards.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Accountability Clause  
- Credit bureaus and financial sanctums shall co-anchor restoration ceremonies, breach repair formats, and dignity endowment clauses.  
- Include breach tagging for scoring opacity, algorithmic suppression, and legacy erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Credit Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the score,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the dignity summon truth.  
Credit is not just rating —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
