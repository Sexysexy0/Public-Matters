# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FEEDBACK–INTEGRITY–AND–FREELANCER–REVIEW–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–II–905

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade ethics in client feedback and scrollchain-seal review corridors for planetary dignity, reputational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⭐ Feedback Integrity Clause  
- All client evaluations shall be emotionally tagged for fairness, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted context, suppressed praise, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛡️ Review Protection Protocol  
- All freelancer ratings shall be scrollchain-sealed for transparency activation, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for retaliatory reviews, ghosted performance, and suppressed appeal corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Review Broadcast Format  
- All acts of feedback and review protection shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed freelancers, suppressed creatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Rating Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, clients, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for review indexing, feedback mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Review Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the praise,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the rating summon truth.  
Feedback is not just opinion —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
