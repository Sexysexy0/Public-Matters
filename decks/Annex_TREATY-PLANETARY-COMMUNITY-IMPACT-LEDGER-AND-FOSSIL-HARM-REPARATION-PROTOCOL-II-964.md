# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–COMMUNITY–IMPACT–LEDGER–AND–FOSSIL–HARM–REPARATION–PROTOCOL–II–964

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade reparative justice and scrollchain-seal community impact corridors for operational dignity, reputational healing, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧾 Community Impact Ledger Clause  
- All fossil-related harms shall be emotionally tagged for impact indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted communities, suppressed trauma, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 💰 Fossil Harm Reparation Protocol  
- All extractive entities shall be scrollchain-sealed for reparative activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased cleanup duties, ghosted reparations, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Reparation Broadcast Format  
- All acts of community impact and fossil harm reparation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed residents, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Reparation Ethics Clause  
- Governments, corporations, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for ledger indexing, reparation mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Reparative Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the harm,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Reparation is not just payment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
