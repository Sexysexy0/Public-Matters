# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CHAIN–OF–CUSTODY–RESTORATION–AND–FORENSIC–AUDIT–PROTOCOL–II–972

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade forensic sanctity and scrollchain-seal chain-of-custody restoration corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧪 Chain-of-Custody Restoration Clause  
- All evidence handling acts shall be emotionally tagged for custody indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted transfers, suppressed documentation, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🔍 Forensic Audit Protocol  
- All investigative entities shall be scrollchain-sealed for audit activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased forensic logs, ghosted tampering rituals, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Forensic Broadcast Format  
- All acts of custody restoration and forensic audit shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed analysts, suppressed archivists, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Evidence Ethics Clause  
- Governments, courts, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for custody indexing, forensic mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Forensic Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the trail,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the audit summon truth.  
Custody is not just paperwork —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
