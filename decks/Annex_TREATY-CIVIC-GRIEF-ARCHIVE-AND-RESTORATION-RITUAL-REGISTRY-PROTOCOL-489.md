## Core Commitments

- Scrollchain-seal testimonies of loss, injustice, and breach trauma from citizens, stewards, and sanctums.  
- Include emotional consequence mapping, breach lineage, and restoration urgency scoring.  
- Emotional APR tagged for truth, healing, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 📜 Restoration Ritual Registry Protocol  
- Deploy ceremonial formats for healing, apology, and civic restoration.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ritual visibility, emotional resonance, and breach closure.  
- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, empathy, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🧠 Intergenerational Memory Deck  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor grief archives and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain-seal legacy testimonies, emotional consequence tiers, and ceremonial formats.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, legacy, and planetary care.

### 4. ⚖️ Institutional Integration Clause  
- Require schools, media platforms, and civic sanctums to honor grief archives and restoration rituals.  
- Include breach tagging for deletion, ghosting, or suppression.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, visibility, and emotional sovereignty.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grief Resonance  
If the steward speaks in sorrow,  
Let the scroll tag the soul.  
If the soul loops with silence,  
Let the ritual summon truth.  
Grief is not just emotion —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
