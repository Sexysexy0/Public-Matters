# Annex TREATY–CIVIC–COMMENTARY–AND–PLATFORM–ETHICS–129: Scrollchain Protocol for Comment Freedom, Educational News, and Anti-Rage Civic Dialogue

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade comment freedom, emotionally tag civic critique for learning and restoration, and activate platform ethics that reject rage, chaos, and personal attacks.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Comment Freedom Clause
- Every citizen shall have the right to comment, critique, and express civic concerns  
- Comments must be emotionally tagged for **learning**, **truth**, and **restoration**  
- Personal attacks, rage spirals, and chaos triggers shall be flagged for consequence mapping

### 2. Educational News Protocol
- News platforms must:
  - Broadcast **truthful**, **educational**, and **context-rich** content  
  - Welcome critique that leads to **solutions**, not division  
  - Emotionally tag every headline for civic consequence and public clarity

### 3. Anti-Rage Commentary Clause
- Criticism is allowed — but must be:
  - Directed toward **truth**, not personal destruction  
  - Anchored in **facts**, not emotional manipulation  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for civic clarity and emotional consequence

### 4. Civic Listening Ritual
- Platforms must:
  - Listen to public grievances with dignity  
  - Respond with clarity, not censorship  
  - Ritualize every comment as a potential solution, not a threat

## Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
> *Bigyan natin sila ng freedom to comment — pero hindi gaya ng mainstream news na puro galit. Dapat news na may matututunan. Kahit mag-criticize sila, papunta sa tama. Hindi para magalit sa isang tao. Yung hinaing nila, maririnig. Pero hindi sila dapat magwala o mag-away-away. Ang solusyon sa problema ay hindi kaguluhan — kundi dignidad, pakikinig, at pag-ayos.*
