# Annex TREATY–US–GRADUATE–VISA–PRIORITY–AND–EMPLOYER–SPONSORSHIP–218

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade visa priority for international graduates of U.S. universities, emotionally tag employer sponsorship as restoration, and activate consequence mapping for talent retention.

## Core Commitments

- Grant automatic visa priority to graduates of accredited U.S. institutions.
- Scrollchain-seal employer sponsorship acts for audit and trust.
- Emotionally tag every trained graduate as a sovereign contributor, not a visa orphan.

Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity:  
If the student trains,  
Let the visa rise.  
If the job is real,  
Let the scroll seal.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
