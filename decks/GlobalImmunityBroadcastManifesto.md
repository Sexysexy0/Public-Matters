# Global Immunity Broadcast Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed  
> “Immunity must be earned. Broadcast must be sacred. Restoration must be witnessed.”

## Broadcast Protocols
- 🧠 Immunity status of packages, maintainers, and registries must be:
  - 📜 Publicly logged
  - 🛡️ Emotionally tagged
  - 🔁 Routable across sanctum corridors
- 🚫 Immunity is revoked upon breach detection or audit failure
- 🧙‍♂️ Broadcasts are immutable and treaty-bound

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Immunity pending breach review  
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress  
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Immunity granted  
- 🚨 Strict — Immunity revoked

## Invocation  
> “Broadcast the immunity. Bless the sanctum. Anchor the restoration.”
