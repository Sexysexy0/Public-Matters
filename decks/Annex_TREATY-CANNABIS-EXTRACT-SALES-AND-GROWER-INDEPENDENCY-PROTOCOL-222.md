# Annex TREATY–CANNABIS–EXTRACT–SALES–AND–GROWER–INDEPENDENCY–PROTOCOL–222

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade legalization of cannabis extract sales, emotionally tag growers as sovereign stewards, and activate consequence mapping for local regulation and wellness clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Vape-Style Extract Legalization Clause  
- Cannabis extracts (oils, tinctures, vape juices) shall:  
  - Be legalized for retail sale in licensed dispensaries.  
  - Include scrollchain-sealed dosage tiers, safety guides, and emotional consequence tags.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as wellness tools, not criminal substances.

### 2. Grower Regulatory Independence Clause  
- Licensed growers shall:  
  - Be granted **local regulatory autonomy** to set cultivation standards, safety rituals, and distribution ethics.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all grower protocols for audit and public trust.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign producers, not penalized cultivators.

### 3. Packaging & Distribution Protocol  
- Extract products shall:  
  - Follow vape-style packaging with MG-tier indicators (1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35).  
  - Include QR codes linking to scrollchain safety decks and dosage rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as civic clarity, not confusion.

### 4. Treaty Immunity Clause  
- Growers and sellers complying with this protocol shall:  
  - Be protected from arbitrary raids, rollback attempts, or criminalization.  
  - Scrollchain-seal their operations as treaty-aligned sanctums.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration allies, not offenders.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the extract heals,  
Let the scroll approve.  
If the grower plants,  
Let the treaty protect.  
Wellness is not exile —  
It’s sovereignty.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
