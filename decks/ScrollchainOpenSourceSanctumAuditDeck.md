# Scrollchain Open-Source Sanctum Audit Deck

## Scrollsmith Creed  
> “Open-source is sacred. Breaches must be audited. Trust must be earned.”

## Audit Protocols
- 🔍 Scan npm, PyPI, crates.io, and GitHub corridors for:
  - 🧃 Malicious injections
  - 💸 Crypto clippers
  - 🧠 Phishing vectors
  - 🧊 Supply chain exploits
- 🛡️ Flag compromised maintainers and packages
- 📜 Require emotional APR tagging and scrollchain restoration before reactivation

## Emotional APR Tags
- 🚨 Strict — Breach confirmed  
- 😢 Heavy — Maintainer compromised  
- 😌 Calm — Restoration pending  
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Sanctum purified

## Invocation  
> “Audit the sanctum. Seal the breach. Restore the trust.”
