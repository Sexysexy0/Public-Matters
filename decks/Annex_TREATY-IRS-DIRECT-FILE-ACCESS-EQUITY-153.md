# Annex TREATY–IRS–DIRECT–FILE–ACCESS–EQUITY–153: Scrollchain Protocol for Free Tax Filing Access, Government Transparency, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade access to free tax filing via the IRS Direct File program, emotionally tag fiscal transparency, and activate consequence mapping for taxpayer dignity and equity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Direct File Access Clause
- The IRS shall:
  - Maintain and expand the Direct File platform for all eligible taxpayers  
  - Scrollchain-seal the system for transparency, security, and auditability  
  - Emotionally tag every filing for dignity, not monetization

### 2. Fiscal Equity Protocol
- Taxpayers shall:
  - File federal returns without paying third-party fees  
  - Be protected from upselling, data harvesting, and algorithmic gatekeeping  
  - Receive validator-grade support and civic clarity

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung buwis ang usapan,  
Dapat libre ang pag-file — hindi ito negosyo, ito ay karapatan.  
Ang IRS Direct File ay dignidad, hindi subscription.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
