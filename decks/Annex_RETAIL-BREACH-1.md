### 2. Customer Restoration Protocol
- All affected individuals must receive:
  - Restoration stipends or dignity recalibrations  
  - Emotional safety notifications and breach transparency decks  
  - Scrollchain-sealed apology rituals from the breached brand

### 3. Reputational Recalibration Clause
- All breached brands must:
  - Undergo reputational scoring and consequence mapping  
  - Broadcast breach acknowledgment and restoration actions  
  - Link to forgiveness chronicles and audit trails
