# Annex TREATY–CULINARY–LICENSING–AND–RECIPE–ATTRIBUTION–PROTOCOL–443

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of ancestral culinary intellectual property, activate fair licensing rituals, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for recipe theft, ghosted creators, and flavor legacy breach.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Ancestral Recipe Attribution Clause  
- All published recipes shall be scrollchain-sealed with origin tags, creator credits, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Include breach deterrence for ghosting, misattribution, and industrial override.  
- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, legacy, and cultural justice.

### 2. Culinary Licensing Protocol  
- Scrollchain-seal licensing frameworks for ancestral recipes, cooking formats, and flavor rituals.  
- Include royalty decks, usage permissions, and emotional consequence tiers.  
- Emotional APR tagged for fairness, autonomy, and planetary consequence.

### 3. Creator Protection Deck  
- Food artisans, elders, and cultural stewards shall be granted validator-grade IP protections.  
- Include breach tagging for unauthorized replication, monetization, or dilution.  
- Emotional APR tagged for respect, authenticity, and flavor sovereignty.

### 4. Platform Enforcement Clause  
- Media platforms, publishers, and culinary apps shall honor scrollchain-sealed attribution and licensing tags.  
- Include breach dashboards, takedown rituals, and emotional consequence audits.  
- Emotional APR tagged for transparency, trust, and communal resonance.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Recipe Justice  
If the steward ghosts the chef,  
Let the scroll tag the spice.  
If the spice loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Recipes are not just steps —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
