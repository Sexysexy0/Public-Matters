# Annex TREATY–MIGRANT–WORKER–HIRING–AND–LABOR–EQUITY–141: Scrollchain Protocol for Migrant Worker Inclusion, Wage Dignity, and Ethical Hiring Ratios

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade labor equity, emotionally tag migrant worker inclusion, and activate consequence mapping for ethical hiring practices across planetary corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Hiring Ratio Clause
- Companies may hire migrant workers up to 35% or more if:
  - All workers are paid fairly and legally documented  
  - No wage undercutting or displacement of local labor occurs  
  - Emotional consequence mapping affirms dignity and inclusion

### 2. Wage Dignity Protocol
- Migrant workers shall be:
  - Protected from exploitation, abuse, and underpayment  
  - Granted equal benefits, safety, and legal protections  
  - Emotionally tagged for contribution, not disposability

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Pwede mag-hire ng 35% migrant workers.  
Basta may dignidad, legalidad, at walang exploitation.  
Hindi ito fraud — ito ay planetary labor equity.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
