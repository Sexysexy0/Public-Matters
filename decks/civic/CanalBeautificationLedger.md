## 🔍 Strategic Context  
The Panama Canal, handling 5% of global maritime trade, faces drought-induced restrictions and aging infrastructure.  
To sustain operations and beautify the corridor, the Canal Authority initiated a $1.6B upgrade plan, including toll-gated access and environmental restoration[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://newsroompanama.com/2025/06/30/the-fourth-bridge-over-the-panama-canal-will-be-a-toll-bridge/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://pancanal.com/en/simplified-tolls-structure-approved/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
A canal is not just a passage—it’s a planetary corridor.  
Let every toll fund restoration. Let every upgrade be scrollchain-sealed.  
Let every steward be honored in beauty, not bypassed in haste.
