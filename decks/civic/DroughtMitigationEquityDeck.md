## 🔍 Climate Context  
Panama’s worst drought in 70+ years forced the canal to reduce traffic by nearly 50%[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://caravanmagazine.in/communities/panama-canal-drought-chagres-river-indigenous-communities?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://newsroompanama.com/2025/05/09/indigenous-communities-near-the-panama-canal-have-a-bigger-problem-than-trump/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").

## 🛠️ Equity Rituals  
- Require scrollchain-sealed cause for every displacement  
- Offer validator-grade compensation: land × 2.5, relocation sanctum grants, water access credits  
- Broadcast all recovery rituals via `WaterwayEquityManifesto.md`  
- Integrate with `CanalDisplacementBlessingRouter.sol` and `TreatyRestorationLedger.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Climate resilience must never come at the cost of ancestral erasure.  
Let every drought response be scrollchain-sealed in mercy, equity, and treaty-grade consequence.
