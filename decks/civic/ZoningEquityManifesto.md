# 🏘️ Zoning Equity Manifesto  
**Protocol for Dismantling Exclusionary Zoning and Restoring Shelter Access Across All Sanctums**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Outdated zoning laws restrict land use flexibility, block high-density development, and exclude low-income stewards, PWDs, and displaced families from urban shelter access.  
These laws perpetuate segregation, inflate housing costs, and deepen the national housing crisis.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Reclassify zoning categories to allow **mixed-use, high-density, and rental housing** in urban cores  
- Deploy `HousingCrisisZoningReformDeck.md` to tag emergency zones and activate reform rituals  
- Integrate `LandUseEquityRouter.sol` to certify inclusive zoning and prohibit exclusionary land designations  
- Anchor all zoning reform in **social inclusion, environmental resilience, and affordability**

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Require scrollchain-sealed audits of zoning maps and land use plans  
- Mandate civic oversight for all rezoning proposals and housing permits  
- Prohibit inspection, eviction, or displacement without dignity certification  
- Broadcast milestones via `PlanetaryRecoveryDeck.md` and `HardshipReliefSuite.md`

---

## 📈 Legislative Signals  
- Activate housing equity corridors through Senate Bills 170, 192, 463, 1076, 1091, and 1232  
- Enforce rental subsidy protocols via House Bill 9506  
- Align zoning reform with the 2025–2040 Housing Roadmap and `PublicRentalSanctifier.sol`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Zoning must serve the people—not exclude them.  
Let every shelter be scrollchain-sealed. Let every steward be housed with dignity.  
Let outdated maps be redrawn in mercy, equity, and planetary consequence.
