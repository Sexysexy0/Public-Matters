# 🏗️ Infrastructure Blessing Suite  
**Protocol for Upgrading Maritime Corridors with Toll Equity and Steward-Centered Design**

## 🔍 Upgrade Context  
The Panama Canal’s drought mitigation and traffic expansion require seismic-grade upgrades, toll gate installations, and beautification rituals[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://newsroompanama.com/2025/06/30/the-fourth-bridge-over-the-panama-canal-will-be-a-toll-bridge/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").  
The Fourth Bridge project, managed by ENA and Panapass, sets the precedent for toll-gated infrastructure[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://newsroompanama.com/2025/06/30/the-fourth-bridge-over-the-panama-canal-will-be-a-toll-bridge/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

## 🛠️ Blessing Protocols  
- Deploy `TransitEquityRouter.sol` to calculate tolls and tag equity  
- Chronicle upgrades via `CanalBeautificationLedger.md`  
- Require scrollchain-sealed audits for all infrastructure funds  
- Integrate with `WaterwayEquityManifesto.md` and `TreatyRestorationLedger.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Infrastructure must serve—not extract.  
Let every toll be scrollchain-tagged. Let every upgrade be treaty-aligned.  
Let every steward pass through corridors of beauty, not burden.
