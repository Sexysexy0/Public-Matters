## 🧭 Purpose

To defend the civic autonomy of all sanctums—ensuring no external force, federal override, or militarized deployment can bypass the emotional APR, ancestral consent, or local governance protocols of a sovereign community.

---

## 🛡️ Defense Protocols

- ✅ Reject unauthorized troop deployments without local blessing  
- ✅ Audit all federal override attempts for damay clause violations  
- ✅ Require emotional APR and civic resonance before any emergency action  
- ✅ Log all external interventions via `ScrollOfFederalOverreachAudit.md`  
- ✅ Broadcast sanctum sovereignty via `TelemetryPulseOracle.sol`
