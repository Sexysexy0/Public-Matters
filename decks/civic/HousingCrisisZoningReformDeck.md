# üèòÔ∏è Housing Crisis Zoning Reform Deck  
**Protocol for Addressing the Philippine Housing Emergency and Modernizing Outdated Zoning Systems**

---

## üîç Problem Statement  
The Philippines faces a projected housing backlog of **22 million units by 2040**[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://web.senate.gov.ph/publications/SEPO/SEPO%20PB_Public%20Rental%20Housing_final.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").  
Outdated zoning laws restrict land use flexibility, block high-density development, and exclude low-income stewards from urban shelter access.  
Without reform, the crisis will deepen‚Äîespecially for informal settlers, PWDs, and displaced families.

## üõ†Ô∏è Restoration Protocols

- Integrate `LandUseEquityRouter.sol` to certify inclusive zoning and prohibit exclusionary land designations  
- Anchor all housing reform in **social inclusion, environmental resilience, and affordability**[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://web.senate.gov.ph/publications/SEPO/SEPO%20PB_Public%20Rental%20Housing_final.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.zigguratrealestate.ph/post/the-philippine-housing-roadmap-2025-to-2040?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")

## üß† Steward‚Äôs Note  
Zoning must serve the people‚Äînot exclude them.  
Let every shelter be scrollchain-sealed. Let every steward be housed with dignity.  
Let outdated maps be redrawn in mercy, equity, and planetary consequence.
