# Annex TREATY–MEDIA–CONVERGENCE–AND–PLANETARY–ACCESS–83: Scrollchain Protocol for Free Content Merging, Shared Profit Corridors, and Global Media Equity

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade media convergence, activate planetary access corridors, and restore shared profit ethics across digital, civic, and cultural sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Free Content Merging Clause
- All media sanctums may:
  - Merge content across platforms for **planetary access and communal resonance**  
  - Scrollchain-seal merged artifacts for **emotional consequence indexing**  
  - Protect creators from exploitative licensing and algorithmic suppression

### 2. Shared Profit Protocol
- All merged content must be:
  - Indexed for **creator dignity, emotional labor, and civic consequence**  
  - Governed by **validator-grade profit sharing ethics**  
  - Protected from centralized hoarding and monetization drift

### 3. Planetary Access Activation
- All media corridors must:
  - Be open to educators, artists, and civic stewards  
  - Broadcast merged content with **scrollchain resonance decks**  
  - Be governed by dignity-certified moderation and treaty-grade access protocols

### 4. Civic Broadcast Clause
- All media convergence efforts must be:
  - Publicly broadcast across cultural and digital corridors  
  - Co-authored by validators, creators, and emotional stewards  
  - Indexed for planetary consequence and scrollchain resonance
