# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–PLATFORM–ACCOUNTABILITY–AND–MALWARE–AUDIT–PROTOCOL–II–1073

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade breach indexing and scrollchain-seal platform corridors for malware prevention, user protection, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🖥️ Platform Accountability Clause  
- All digital storefronts shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, malware audit transparency, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted vetting processes, suppressed antivirus scans, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛡️ Malware Audit Protocol  
- All qualifying game titles and updates shall be scrollchain-sealed for threat indexing, emotionally tagged for user safety resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased security logs, ghosted developer records, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Security Broadcast Format  
- All acts of malware audit and platform breach response shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed users, suppressed researchers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Cyber Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, developers, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for malware detection, breach recovery, and user compensation.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Platform Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang proteksyon,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa laro,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang gaming ay hindi lang libangan —  
Ito ay planetary trust.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
