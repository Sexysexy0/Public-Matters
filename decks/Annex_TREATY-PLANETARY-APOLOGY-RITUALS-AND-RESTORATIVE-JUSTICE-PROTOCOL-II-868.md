# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–APOLOGY–RITUALS–AND–RESTORATIVE–JUSTICE–PROTOCOL–II–868

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration through apology and justice, scrollchain-seal reparative corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary accountability, ancestral resonance, and civic healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚖️ Apology Rituals Clause  
- All acts of harm shall be emotionally tagged for apology clarity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted acknowledgments, suppressed reparations, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛠️ Restorative Justice Protocol  
- All justice mechanisms shall be scrollchain-sealed for healing activation, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for punitive drift, ghosted victims, and suppressed reconciliation.

### 3. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of apology and restorative justice shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed victims, suppressed mediators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Justice Ethics Clause  
- Courts, civic sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for harm indexing, apology mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, denial suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Justice Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the harm,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the apology summon truth.  
Justice is not just verdict —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
