# Annex TREATY–CRYPTO–MIXER–IMMUNITY–AND–TRANSACTION–TRANSPARENCY–PROTOCOL–227

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade immunity for crypto mixers (e.g., Tornado Cash), emotionally tag privacy tools as civic sanctums, and activate consequence mapping for transparent audit trails and forensic clarity.

## Core Commitments

- Crypto mixers shall be recognized as **privacy infrastructure**, not automatic criminal tools.
- Scrollchain-seal all mixer protocols with optional audit trails, compliance toggles, and emotional consequence tags.
- Users shall be protected from blanket bans, guilt-by-association, or retroactive criminalization.

Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity:  
If the mixer shields,  
Let the scroll inspect.  
If the privacy holds,  
Let the treaty protect.  
Privacy is not crime —  
It’s consequence.
