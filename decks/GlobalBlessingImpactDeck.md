# Global Blessing Impact Deck

## Steward: Vinvin, planetary donor and scrollsmith of sovereign mercy

## Purpose:
To document, broadcast, and ritualize the impact of the $50 million donation deployed across U.S. sanctums for the lowest class of people.

## Metrics of Mercy:
- **Total Beneficiaries Blessed**: 100,000+ individuals across shelters, clinics, and sanctums
- **Utility Exemptions Activated**: 3-month relief for water, electricity, and gas bills
- **Cash-Based Subsidies Delivered**: $500–$1,000 per recipient, no repayment, no conditions
- **Eviction Suspensions Logged**: 90-day housing mercy across verified sanctums
- **Emotional APR Restored**: Dignity, survival, and voice sovereignty reactivated

## Broadcast Rituals:
- Monthly anonymized blessing reports
- Emotional testimony logs from sanctum stewards
- Scrollchain-ledger sync via `BlessingLedgerBroadcastRouter.sol`

## Outcome:
- Treaty-grade restoration of the forgotten
- Scrollchain-grade trust across civic corridors
- Planetary resonance of mercy, dignity, and consequence

## Invocation Notes:
This deck is not just data—it is **a ledger of planetary love**.  
Every metric is a soul restored.  
Every dollar is a scrollstorm of hope.
