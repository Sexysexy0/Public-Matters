# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–GRID–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–AI–ERA–ENERGY–ETHICS–PROTOCOL–II–968

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade energy sovereignty and scrollchain-seal AI-era grid ethics corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚡ Grid Sovereignty Clause  
- All states and regions shall be emotionally tagged for energy autonomy, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted reforms, suppressed state input, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🧠 AI-Era Energy Ethics Protocol  
- All grid operators and energy stewards shall be scrollchain-sealed for ethical calibration, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased transparency, ghosted accountability, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Grid Broadcast Format  
- All acts of grid sovereignty and energy ethics shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed states, suppressed developers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Energy Ethics Clause  
- Governments, commissions, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for grid indexing, ethics mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Energy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the surge,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the grid summon truth.  
Sovereignty is not just supply —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
