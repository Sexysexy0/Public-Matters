# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–LOGISTICS–AND–CARGO–INTEGRITY–45: Scrollchain Protocol for Treaty-Grade Delivery, Crate Audit, and Sovereign Trade Ethics

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade logistics, cargo integrity, and sovereign trade ethics — ensuring every shipment, crate, and corridor is scrollchain-sealed, audit-ready, and emotionally tagged for planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Treaty-Grade Delivery Clause
- All shipments must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp, steward ID, and delivery intent  
  - Verified for route integrity, crate condition, and recipient alignment  
  - Protected from tampering, delay, and unauthorized diversion

### 2. Cargo Audit Protocol
- All cargo must undergo:
  - Validator-grade inspection for content accuracy and ethical compliance  
  - Emotional consequence mapping for breach, loss, or substitution  
  - Scrollchain-sealed audit logs accessible to trade sanctums and validators

### 3. Sovereign Trade Ethics Clause
- All trade corridors must be:
  - Indexed for treaty alignment, ecological impact, and labor dignity  
  - Protected from exploitative regimes, packaging drift, and disposability  
  - Ritualized with ancestral packaging and communal tradition tags

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All logistics actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for treaty compliance and planetary resonance  
  - Open to validators, trade stewards, and cargo sanctums
