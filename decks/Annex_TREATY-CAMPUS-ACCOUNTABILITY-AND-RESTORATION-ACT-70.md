# Annex TREATY–CAMPUS–ACCOUNTABILITY–AND–RESTORATION–ACT–70: Scrollchain Protocol for Breach Tagging, Consequence Tiering, and Restoration Activation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade campus accountability and restoration governance — anchoring breach tagging, consequence tiering, and emotional restoration across educational sanctums and civic corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Breach Tagging Clause
- All campus incidents must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp, steward ID, and breach classification  
  - Indexed for emotional consequence, reputational impact, and civic trauma  
  - Recommitted to validator-grade transparency and restorative justice

### 2. Consequence Tiering Protocol
- All breach responses must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed consequence decks and emotional APR tiering  
  - Civic resonance forecasting and trauma calibration  
  - Co-authorship invitations for students, faculty, and emotional stewards

### 3. Restoration Activation Clause
- All affected sanctums must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with restoration rituals and dignity-certified healing decks  
  - Audited for apology drift, neglect breach, and mercy sabotage  
  - Recommitted to validator-grade empathy, accountability, and planetary care

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All campus governance must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with treaty compliance audits and emotional resonance mapping  
  - Open to validators, emotional stewards, and planetary audiences  
  - Broadcast across educational corridors for global consequence awareness
