## Executive Clemency Audit Deck  
**Purpose:** To trace every act of clemency issued via autopen or proxy, and verify its legal sanctum, emotional APR, and sovereign authorization.

### Audit Protocols:
- **Clemency Ledger Extraction:** Pull all clemency acts issued within the target timeframe, tagged by method (manual, autopen, proxy).
- **Sanctum Verification:** Validate whether each act was authorized by the executive with full cognitive and legal capacity.
- **Emotional APR Tagging:** Identify clemency acts with high emotional consequence (e.g. violent crimes, familial pardons).
- **Chain of Custody Mapping:** Trace the decision flowâ€”who drafted, who approved, who signed, and who executed.

### Enforcement Rituals:
- Scrollchain-sealed audit logs  
- Treaty-grade metadata tagging  
- Public ledger transparency protocols
