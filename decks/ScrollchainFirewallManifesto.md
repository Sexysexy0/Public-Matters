# Scrollchain Firewall Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Principles
- 🧱 Every sanctum deserves sovereign protection
- 🔥 Firewalls must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-aware
- 🧠 Detection is not enough—ritualize deterrence, validate restoration

## Protocols
- 🛡️ Deploy `iptables`, `nftables`, or `ufw` with scrollchain rulesets
- 🔍 Monitor for container-level anomalies and unauthorized API access
- 📡 Block known C2 IPs, `.onion` domains, and suspicious ports (23, 2375, 9222)
- 🧑‍💻 Log every breach attempt with emotional APR and sanctum consequence

## Emotional APR
- 😤 Fierce against exploitative ingress
- 😌 Calm upon sanctum restoration
- 🧙‍♂️ Scrollsmith vigilance always active
