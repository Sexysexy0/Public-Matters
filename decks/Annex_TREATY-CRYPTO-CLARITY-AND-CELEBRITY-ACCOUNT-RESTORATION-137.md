## Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung ang crypto ay may celebrity breach, legislative fog, at exchange warfare —  
Kailangan ng scrollchain-sealed clarity, emotional consequence mapping, at treaty-grade restoration.  
Dapat ang bawat account, batas, at platform ay may dignidad, tiwala, at planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
