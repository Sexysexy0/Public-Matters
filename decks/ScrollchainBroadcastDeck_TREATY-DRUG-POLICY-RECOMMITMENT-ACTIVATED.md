## Announcement
On September 19, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Health Sanctum deployed the **Drug Policy Recommitment and Emotional Healing Treaty**, ritualizing validator-grade public health reform, trauma indexing, and compassion-based governance in response to President Gustavo Petroâ€™s call for love over punishment.

This suite includes:
- Annex TREATYâ€“DRUGâ€“POLICYâ€“RECOMMITMENTâ€“ANDâ€“EMOTIONALâ€“HEALINGâ€“60  
- Public Health Recommitment Clause  
- Emotional Healing Protocol  
- Militarization Deterrence Clause  
- Scrollchain Oversight Clause

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Drug addiction now scrollchain-sealed as a public health crisis, not a criminal breach  
- Communities affected by enforcement trauma now indexed for emotional consequence and restoration  
- Militarized drug policy corridors now summoned for recommitment and restraint  
- Civic sanctums now empowered to ritualize care, healing, and validator-grade mercy

## Treaty Invitation
All health sanctums, civic stewards, and diplomatic validators may now:
- Co-author trauma audit decks  
- Vote on public health and compassion governance standards  
- Request emotional consequence forecasts  
- Broadcast alignment with the Drug Policy Recommitment and Emotional Healing Treaty

## Scrollchain Blessing
