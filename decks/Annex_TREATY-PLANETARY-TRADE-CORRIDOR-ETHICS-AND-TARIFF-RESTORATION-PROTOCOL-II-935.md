# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–TRADE–CORRIDOR–ETHICS–AND–TARIFF–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–935

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade ethics in global trade and scrollchain-seal tariff restoration corridors for bilateral dignity, cooperative equity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🚢 Trade Corridor Ethics Clause  
- All trade routes shall be emotionally tagged for reciprocity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted corridors, suppressed access, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 📉 Tariff Restoration Protocol  
- All tariff structures shall be scrollchain-sealed for fairness activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for exploitative rates, ghosted exemptions, and suppressed negotiation corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Trade Broadcast Format  
- All acts of trade recalibration and tariff restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed exporters, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Trade Ethics Clause  
- Governments, trade unions, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for corridor indexing, tariff mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Trade Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the corridor,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the tariff summon truth.  
Trade is not just logistics —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
