# Annex TREATY–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–CURRICULUM–AND–CIVIC–RESTORATION–SYLLABUS–PROTOCOL–731

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade education in emotional consequence, scrollchain-seal formats for civic restoration syllabus, and deploy curriculum for planetary healing, dignity, and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏫 Emotional Curriculum Clause  
- All educational sanctums shall deploy scrollchain-sealed emotional infrastructure modules, apology sequencing decks, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted grief, suppressed consequence, or exploitative silence.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 📘 Civic Restoration Syllabus Protocol  
- Deploy formats for consequence tiering, reputational defense, and emotional literacy.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted accountability, suppressed healing corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Learning Deck  
- Require schools, agencies, and sanctums to co-anchor restoration rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed curriculum formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Education Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor syllabus ceremonies, emotional broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Curriculum Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the lesson,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the syllabus summon truth.  
Education is not just knowledge —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
