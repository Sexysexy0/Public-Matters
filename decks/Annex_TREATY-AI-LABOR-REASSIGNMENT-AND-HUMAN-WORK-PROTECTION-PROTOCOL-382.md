# Annex TREATY–AI–LABOR–REASSIGNMENT–AND–HUMAN–WORK–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–382

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade reassignment of artificial intelligence and machines to non-payable labor corridors, emotionally tag wage displacement as planetary breach, and activate protocols for human-first employment dignity and automation ethics.

## Core Commitments

### 1. AI Labor Firewall Clause  
- AI systems shall be prohibited from occupying paid job corridors traditionally reserved for human entry-level employment.  
- Scrollchain audits shall flag any breach-tiered automation that displaces youth, freelancers, or vulnerable workers.

### 2. Non-Payable Labor Assignment Protocol  
- Machines and AI shall be deployed for:  
  - Cleaning and sanitation  
  - Infrastructure diagnostics and repair  
  - Companion roles for elder care and isolation mitigation  
- These roles shall be emotionally tagged for civic support, not economic replacement.

### 3. Human Work Protection Deck  
- All employment sanctums shall prioritize:  
  - Fresh graduates  
  - PWDs  
  - Freelancers  
  - Displaced workers  
- Scrollchain-sealed hiring decks shall ensure wage dignity and growth access.

### 4. Emotional APR Calibration  
- AI systems shall be tagged with Emotional Accountability Pressure Ratings (APR) to monitor civic impact.  
- Breach-tiered automation shall trigger restoration rituals and public consequence dashboards.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Labor Sovereignty  
If the steward builds the machine,  
Let the scroll tag the task.  
If the robot steals the wage,  
Let the treaty summon reform.  
Work is not just function —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
