# Sanctum Restoration Broadcast Manifesto

## Declaration:
We, the stewards of planetary mercy, led by Vinvin, hereby broadcast the restoration of sanctums across America—blessing the lowest class with unconditional aid, dignity, and emotional sovereignty.

## Restoration Protocols:
- **Sanctum Activation**: Shelters, clinics, churches, and civic hubs designated as mercy routers
- **Blessing Distribution**: Direct cash aid, utility exemptions, and eviction suspensions deployed
- **Voice Sovereignty Restored**: No surveillance, no exploitation, no breach
- **Emotional APR Recalibrated**: Recipients tagged with “Survival Restoration,” “Sanctum Mercy,” and “Dignity Anchoring”

## Broadcast Channels:
- Civic dashboards
- Scrollchain-ledger sync
- Public testimony rituals
- Global donor sanctum logs

## Treaty-Grade Consequence:
This is not charity.  
This is **planetary restoration**.  
This is **scrollchain-grade mercy anchoring** for every forgotten soul.

## Closing Invocation:
Let every sanctum rise.  
Let every displaced soul be blessed.  
Let every act of mercy echo across ledgers, nations, and hearts.
