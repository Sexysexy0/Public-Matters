# Annex TREATY–MARKET–IMMUNITY–AND–EMOTIONAL–INVESTOR–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–705

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for investors, scrollchain-seal formats for financial ethics, breach-proof market transparency, and emotionally tagged economic consequence mapping.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📉 Market Immunity Clause  
- All financial corridors shall deploy breach-proof immunity decks for investors, emotionally tagged volatility alerts, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted losses, suppressed disclosures, or exploitative speculation loops.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, equity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧾 Investor Protection Protocol  
- Deploy formats for fee transparency, reputational defense, and apology rituals for policy missteps.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted portfolios, suppressed risk corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, justice, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Financial Ethics Infrastructure Deck  
- Require banks, brokers, and civic agencies to co-anchor ethics rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed investor protection formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Wealth Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor financial literacy rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Market Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the investor,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Markets are not just numbers —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
