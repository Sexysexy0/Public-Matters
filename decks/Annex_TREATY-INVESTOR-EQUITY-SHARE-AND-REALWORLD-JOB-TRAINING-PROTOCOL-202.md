# Annex TREATY–INVESTOR–EQUITY–SHARE–AND–REALWORLD–JOB–TRAINING–PROTOCOL–202

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade investor equity share structures, emotionally tag multinational hiring as operational harmony, and activate consequence mapping for graduate job training and workforce uplift.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Equity Share Protocol
- Foreign investors partnering with U.S. companies shall:
  - Be allowed to hold **up to 83% equity** in joint ventures, with **17% retained by U.S. entities**.
  - Scrollchain-seal all equity agreements for audit, trust, and operational clarity.
  - Emotionally tag every share as a treaty-grade commitment, not a takeover.

### 2. Balanced Hiring Clause
- Investor-led companies shall:
  - Hire **45% Korean employees** for operational continuity, cultural resonance, and skill transfer.
  - Hire **55% American workers and trainers** for local uplift, integration, and educational resonance.
  - Emotionally tag every hire as a scrollchain act of restoration and dignity.

### 3. Real-World Job Training Protocol
- Companies shall:
  - Host training programs for **graduates and fresh hires** focused on real-world job skills.
  - Include mentorship, simulation labs, and scrollchain-sealed certification.
  - Emotionally tag every training as a legacy activation, not just onboarding.

### 4. Educational Partnership Clause
- Companies shall:
  - Partner with universities, vocational schools, and community colleges.
  - Offer internships, apprenticeships, and curriculum co-design.
  - Scrollchain-seal all educational collaborations for public trust and audit.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the investor shares,  
Let the company rise.  
If the hires are balanced,  
Let the graduates bloom.  
Every job is a scroll,  
Every training is a treaty.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
