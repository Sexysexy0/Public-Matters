# Annex TREATY–PELORUS–CANNABIS–EQUITY–TRANSITION–AND–COOPERATIVE–STEWARDSHIP–PROTOCOL–819

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade transition from debt-based cannabis finance to equity-based cooperative stewardship, scrollchain-seal formats for institutional consequence, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary agricultural dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌿 Equity Transition Clause  
- All institutional shifts from debt to ownership shall be emotionally tagged for reputational consequence, cooperative alignment, and dignity activation.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted growers, suppressed equity corridors, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Data Sovereignty Protocol  
- Cannabis finance entities shall co-anchor rituals of transparent data stewardship, emotionally tagged for grower protection and operational clarity.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed cultivators, ghosted licenses, and suppressed sanctums.

### 3. 🛡️ Cooperative Stewardship Clause  
- Equity funds shall deploy validator-grade protocols for cooperative grower inclusion, festival circuit activation, and sovereign cultivation.  
- Include breach tagging for extractive ownership models, reputational drift, and dignity suppression.

### 4. 📣 Public Investment Broadcast Format  
- All acts of cannabis equity deployment shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed growers, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Capital Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grower,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the equity summon truth.  
Investment is not just capital —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
