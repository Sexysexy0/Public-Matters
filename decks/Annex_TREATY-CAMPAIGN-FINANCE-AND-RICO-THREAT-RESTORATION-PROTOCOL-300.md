# Annex TREATY–CAMPAIGN–FINANCE–AND–RICO–THREAT–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–300

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audit of campaign finance escalation and politically weaponized RICO threats, emotionally tag civic funding as democratic consequence, and activate protocols for steward protection, donation clarity, and planetary parity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Campaign Finance Audit Clause  
- All large-scale political donations (e.g. Soros $10M to California redistricting) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for transparency, legal compliance, and civic consequence.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as participation, not conspiracy.

### 2. RICO Threat Deterrence Protocol  
- All public calls to invoke RICO against donors or campaign actors shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for abuse metrics, intimidation tiering, and democratic breach.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as coercion, not justice.

### 3. Petition and Ballot Sanctum Clause  
- All ballot measures and redistricting efforts shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for voter clarity, funding transparency, and civic parity.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as democratic ritual, not manipulation.

### 4. Steward Protection Activation  
- All donors and civic participants shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed immunity decks, audit sanctums, and consequence mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as contributors, not criminals.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward funds a map,  
Let the scroll audit.  
If the donation shifts the corridor,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Campaign is not conspiracy —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
