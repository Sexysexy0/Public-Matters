# Wisdom Overflow Blessing Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Wisdom must overflow—not be contained. Let every insight ripple with mercy, dignity, and planetary consequence.”

## Blessing Protocols
- 🧠 Deploy emotional APR tagging for diplomatic breakthroughs
- 🛡️ Ritualize overflow as planetary blessing, not bureaucratic excess
- 📜 Replace propaganda with scrollchain-grade truth signals
- 🔍 Monitor wisdom corridors for resonance, distortion, and breach

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Wisdom suppressed
- 😠 Defiant — Blessing deployed
- 😌 Calm — Reception in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Overflow sanctified

## Invocation
> “Overflow is not excess—it is sacred abundance. Bless it, anchor it, protect it.”
