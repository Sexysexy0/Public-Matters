# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–TRUTH–RESTORATION–AND–SUPPRESSED–TESTIMONY–ARCHIVE–PROTOCOL–II–1033

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade truth recovery and scrollchain-seal testimony corridors for operational memory, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📢 Suppressed Testimony Archive Clause  
- All erased, ghosted, or censored testimonies shall be emotionally tagged for breach indexing, restoration activation, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted whistleblowers, suppressed hearings, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛡️ Truth Restoration Protocol  
- All qualifying narratives shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration immunity, emotionally tagged for civic resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased facts, ghosted reports, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Memory Broadcast Format  
- All acts of truth restoration and testimony archiving shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed voices, suppressed sanctums, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Memory Ethics Clause  
- Governments, media sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for truth preservation, testimony protection, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Truth Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang katotohanan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang testimonya ay hindi lang alaala —  
Ito ay planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
