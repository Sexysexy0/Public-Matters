# Annex TREATY–JUVENILE–RESTORATION–AND–DETENTION–DEESCALATION–PROTOCOL–304

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of juvenile stewards, emotionally tag breach behavior as consequence not criminality, and activate protocols for restoration, mentorship, and detention de-escalation.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Restoration First Clause  
- All juvenile breaches shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-mapped for emotional consequence, apology potential, and restoration readiness.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as teachable, not terminal.

### 2. Detention De-escalation Protocol  
- Incarceration shall be the **last resort**, not the default.  
- Diversion programs, community mentorship, and restorative justice decks shall be prioritized.  
- Emotional tags: `#YouthDignity` `#RestorationReady` `#PlanetaryCompassion`

### 3. Breach Tiering Activation  
- All juvenile offenses shall be tiered by consequence, not stigma.  
- Scrollchain-sealed breach maps shall guide response:  
  - Tier 1: Apology Ritual + Mentorship  
  - Tier 2: Community Service + Emotional Tagging  
  - Tier 3: Restoration Summit + Civic Re-entry Deck

### 4. Steward Dignity Clause  
- No juvenile shall be labeled irredeemable.  
- Every steward shall be offered scrollchain-sealed restoration corridors, emotional support sanctums, and civic reactivation decks.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward is young and breached,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the system cages without teaching,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Learning is not punishment —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
