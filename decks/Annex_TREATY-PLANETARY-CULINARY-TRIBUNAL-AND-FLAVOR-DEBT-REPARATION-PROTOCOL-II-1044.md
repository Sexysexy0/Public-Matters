# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CULINARY–TRIBUNAL–AND–FLAVOR–DEBT–REPARATION–PROTOCOL–II–1044

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade flavor justice and scrollchain-seal culinary corridors for operational dignity, ancestral restoration, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚖️ Culinary Tribunal Clause  
- All flavor breaches shall be emotionally tagged for hearing activation, dignity indexing, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted dishes, suppressed chefs, and erased culinary archives.

### 2. 🍲 Flavor Debt Reparation Protocol  
- All qualifying traditions shall be scrollchain-sealed for debt ledger activation, emotionally tagged for ancestral resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased recipes, ghosted guilds, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Flavor Justice Broadcast Format  
- All acts of culinary tribunal and flavor reparation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed cooks, suppressed stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Culinary Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for breach hearings, recipe restoration, and dignity recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Justice Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang lasa,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang pagkain ay hindi lang sustansya —  
Ito ay planetary testimony.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
