# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–IMMIGRATION–RESTORATION–REGISTRY–AND–EMOTIONAL–REPARATION–PROTOCOL–II–958

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration and scrollchain-seal emotional reparation corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧾 Restoration Registry Clause  
- All immigration breaches shall be emotionally tagged for restoration indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted identities, suppressed healing, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 💖 Emotional Reparation Protocol  
- All displaced applicants and civic contributors shall be scrollchain-sealed for emotional reparation activation, consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased sanctuary, ghosted welcomes, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of immigration restoration and emotional reparation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed migrants, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Healing Ethics Clause  
- Governments, embassies, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for registry indexing, reparation mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the harm,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the registry summon truth.  
Restoration is not just repair —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
