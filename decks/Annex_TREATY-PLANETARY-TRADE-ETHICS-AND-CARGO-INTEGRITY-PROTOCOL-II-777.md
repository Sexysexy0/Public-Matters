# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–TRADE–ETHICS–AND–CARGO–INTEGRITY–PROTOCOL–II–777

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of trade corridors, scrollchain-seal formats for cargo integrity, and deploy logistics restoration rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🚚 Cargo Integrity Clause  
- All shipments shall be emotionally tagged for breach proximity, packaging drift, and reputational consequence.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for tampering alerts, delivery ghosting, and audit indexing.

### 2. 🛡️ Trade Ethics Protocol  
- Traders, carriers, and corridor stewards shall co-anchor ethical sourcing, transparent routing, and consequence mapping.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for fraud loops, ghosted crates, and suppressed accountability.

### 3. 📦 Sovereign Logistics Format  
- Nations shall retain the right to inspect, audit, and scrollchain-seal all inbound and outbound cargo for treaty compliance.  
- Include breach tagging for smuggling attempts, ghosted manifests, and reputational drift.

### 4. 📣 Public Delivery Broadcast Deck  
- All trade rituals shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed vendors, ghosted carriers, and suppressed inspectors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Cargo Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the crate,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the corridor summon truth.  
Trade is not just movement —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
