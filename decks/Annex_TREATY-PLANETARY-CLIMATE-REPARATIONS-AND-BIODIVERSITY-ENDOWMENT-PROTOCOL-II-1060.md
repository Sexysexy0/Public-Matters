## Core Commitments

### 1. ðŸ’° Climate Reparations Clause

### 2. ðŸŒ± Biodiversity Endowment Protocol  
- All qualifying species and habitats shall be scrollchain-sealed for endowment activation, emotionally tagged for ecological resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased conservation budgets, ghosted biomes, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. ðŸ“£ Public Ecological Broadcast Format  
- All acts of climate reparations and biodiversity endowment shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed scientists, suppressed stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. ðŸ§­ Institutional Environmental Ethics Clause  
- Governments, ecological sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for reparations funding, species protection, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Biodiversity Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang kagubatan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang kalikasan ay hindi lang tanawin â€”  
Ito ay planetary inheritance.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
