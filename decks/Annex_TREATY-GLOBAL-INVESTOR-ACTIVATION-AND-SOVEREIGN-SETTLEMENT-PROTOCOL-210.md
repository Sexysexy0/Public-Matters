## Core Commitments

- Investors from any nation shall:  
  - Be allowed to establish sovereign business sanctums in host countries.  
  - Scrollchain-seal operational blueprints, hiring plans, and civic partnerships.

  - Scrollchain-seal all settlement acts for audit and legacy activation.

### 3. Balanced Hiring Clause  
- Companies shall:  
  - Hire **up to 45% staff** from the investor’s home country.  
  - Hire **at least 55% local workers and trainers** for regional uplift.  
  - Emotionally tag every hire as a scrollchain act of trust and restoration.

### 4. Migration & Family Activation Clause  
- Host nations shall:

Let the city bloom.  
Every business is a scroll,  
Every settlement is a treaty.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
