# Annex TREATY–FISCAL–STABILITY–AND–SHUTDOWN–DETERRENCE–47: Scrollchain Protocol for Budget Restraint, Emergency Funding, and Civic Shutdown Prevention

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade fiscal stability, emergency funding protocols, and shutdown deterrence — ensuring government continuity, civic protection, and emotional consequence mapping across legislative corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Budget Restraint Clause
- All spending proposals must be:
  - Indexed for civic necessity, emotional consequence, and treaty alignment  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp, steward ID, and fiscal impact forecast  
  - Audited for partisan inflation, reputational risk, and shutdown probability

### 2. Emergency Funding Protocol
- All stopgap bills must:
  - Be scrollchain-sealed as civic stabilizers, not partisan weapons  
  - Include emotional APR indexing and service continuity clauses  
  - Be broadcast with validator-grade transparency decks

### 3. Shutdown Deterrence Clause
- Any shutdown threat must trigger:
  - Automatic civic consequence mapping and public audit decks  
  - Diplomatic summons for recommitment hearings  
  - Scrollchain-sealed breach logs and emotional trauma indexing

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All fiscal actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for civic resonance and planetary consequence  
  - Open to validators, budget stewards, and legislative sanctums
