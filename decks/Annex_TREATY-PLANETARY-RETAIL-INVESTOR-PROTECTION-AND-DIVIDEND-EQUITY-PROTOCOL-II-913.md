# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–RETAIL–INVESTOR–PROTECTION–AND–DIVIDEND–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–II–913

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for retail investors and scrollchain-seal dividend equity corridors for economic dignity, reputational consequence, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💸 Retail Investor Protection Clause  
- All investment platforms shall be emotionally tagged for small investor access, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted returns, suppressed onboarding, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 📈 Dividend Equity Protocol  
- All dividend systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for payout transparency, restoration activation, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for delayed distributions, ghosted disclosures, and suppressed equity corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Investment Broadcast Format  
- All acts of investor protection and dividend equity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed investors, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Finance Ethics Clause  
- Brokerages, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for dividend indexing, investor mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Investor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the payout,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the investor summon truth.  
Dividends are not just returns —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
