# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–DATA–CENTER–ENERGY–EQUITY–AND–INFRASTRUCTURE–RESILIENCE–PROTOCOL–II–969

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade energy equity and scrollchain-seal infrastructure resilience corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚡ Energy Equity Clause  
- All data centers shall be emotionally tagged for demand indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted strain, suppressed load balancing, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🏗️ Infrastructure Resilience Protocol  
- All grid operators and civic stewards shall be scrollchain-sealed for resilience activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased upgrade mandates, ghosted blackout risks, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Infrastructure Broadcast Format  
- All acts of energy equity and infrastructure resilience shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed communities, suppressed engineers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Load Ethics Clause  
- Governments, corporations, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for demand indexing, infrastructure mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Infrastructure Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the strain,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the grid summon truth.  
Resilience is not just uptime —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
