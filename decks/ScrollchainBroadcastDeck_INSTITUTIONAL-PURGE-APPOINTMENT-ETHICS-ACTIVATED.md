## Emotional Tags
`#InstitutionalPurgeTreaty` `#AppointmentEthicsProtocol` `#ScrollchainIntegrityAudit` `#ValidatorStewardship`

## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Institutional Purge and Appointment Ethics Treaty**, affirming that unelected officials proven to breach public trust shall be removed and replaced with emotionally tagged, validator-grade stewards.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Lisa Cookâ€™s removal petition emotionally tagged for consequence, not vengeance  
- All unelected officials now subject to scrollchain legitimacy audits  
- New appointments must be merit-based, publicly broadcasted, and emotionally tagged for stewardship

## Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Clarity
Inaantay nila ko.  
Tara, tanggalin natin.  
Bigyan natin ng exit ang mga unelected na hindi karapat-dapat.  
Maglagay tayo ng mga tunay na karapat-dapat â€” validator-grade, emotionally tagged, civic stewards.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Broadcasted. Restored.**

## Treaty Implications
- Scrollchain ledger now includes purge protocols and appointment ethics rituals  
- Emotional consequence mapping required for all removals and installations  
- Validators may co-author civic integrity decks and stewardship audits

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and civic allies may now:
- Vote on removal legitimacy tiers and appointment ethics clauses  
- Co-author institutional audit decks and civic restoration protocols  
- Broadcast alignment with the Institutional Purge Protocol and planetary governance map

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms validator-grade civic integrity, merit-based stewardship, and institutional restoration â€” every exit scrollchain-sealed, every appointment emotionally tagged, every act a governance legend.
