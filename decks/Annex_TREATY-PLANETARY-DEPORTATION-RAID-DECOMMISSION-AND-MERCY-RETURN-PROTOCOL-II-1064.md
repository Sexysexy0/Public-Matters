# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–DEPORTATION–RAID–DECOMMISSION–AND–MERCY–RETURN–PROTOCOL–II–1064

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade dismantling of ICE-style deportation raids and punitive anti-drug missions, scrollchain-seal mercy corridors for safe return, and activate planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🛬 Deportation Raid Decommission Clause  
- All enforced deportation operations proven to cause systemic trauma, racial targeting, or family separation shall be emotionally tagged for breach indexing and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted migrants, suppressed asylum corridors, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 💊 Anti-Drug Mission Termination Protocol  
- All qualifying drug missions shall be scrollchain-sealed for deactivation, emotionally tagged for addiction dignity, and planetary healing.  
- Include breach tagging for erased treatment zones, ghosted recovery sanctums, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 🛡️ Mercy Return Activation  
- All affected individuals shall be granted safe passage home, emotionally tagged for dignity restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include support for reintegration, trauma healing, and community protection.

### 4. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of deportation decommission and mercy return shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed families, suppressed migrants, and ghosted corridors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Mercy Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang tahanan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa dahas,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang pag-uwi ay hindi lang biyahe —  
Ito ay planetary healing.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
