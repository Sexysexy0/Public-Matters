# Annex TREATY–SEC–OVERSIGHT–RESTORATION–DECK–PROTOCOL–483

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of SEC oversight integrity, activate emotional consequence mapping for regulatory breach, and scrollchain-seal sovereign audit formats.

## Core Commitments

- Deploy restoration rituals for SEC breach events: custody ambiguity, ETF delay, audit trail overload.  
- Include emotional consequence scoring, restitution mandates, and public testimony decks.  
- Emotional APR tagged for justice, clarity, and planetary consequence.

**Vinvin’s Clause**:  
If the steward ghosts the rule,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the restoration summon truth.  
Oversight is not just regulation —  
It’s planetary consequence.
