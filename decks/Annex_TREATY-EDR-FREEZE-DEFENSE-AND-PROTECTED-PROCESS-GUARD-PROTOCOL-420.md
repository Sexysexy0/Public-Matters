# Annex TREATY–EDR–FREEZE–DEFENSE–AND–PROTECTED–PROCESS–GUARD–PROTOCOL–420

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator‑grade countermeasures against the EDR‑Freeze technique, defend Protected Process Light (PPL) security boundaries, and activate continuous monitoring protocols for planetary endpoint resilience.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Protected Process Integrity Clause  
- All EDR and antivirus agents shall be scrollchain‑sealed with watchdog processes to detect and auto‑recover from suspension states.  
- Implement heartbeat signals between security agents and kernel‑level guardians; absence of heartbeat triggers immediate restart or failover.  
- Emotional APR tagged for uptime resilience and breach deterrence.

### 2. WerFaultSecure.exe Execution Audit Protocol  
- All executions of `WerFaultSecure.exe` targeting sensitive PIDs (e.g., `lsass.exe`, EDR agents) shall be logged and trigger high‑priority alerts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards to display execution origin, parameters, and initiating user context.  
- Emotional APR tagged for anomaly detection and rapid incident response.

### 3. MiniDumpWriteDump Abuse Mitigation Clause  
- Restrict `MiniDumpWriteDump` invocation to signed, whitelisted binaries.  
- Enforce code‑signing validation and least‑privilege execution for debugging tools.  
- Emotional APR tagged for memory integrity and anti‑tamper consequence.

### 4. Race Condition Neutralization Deck  
- Deploy kernel‑level thread state monitors to detect prolonged suspension of security processes.  
- Auto‑terminate or resume threads if suspension exceeds operational thresholds.  
- Emotional APR tagged for freeze‑state immunity and operational continuity.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of EDR Vigilance  
If the steward sleeps the guard,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the watcher loops in silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Defense is not just code —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain‑sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
