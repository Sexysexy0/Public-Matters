# Annex TREATY–GRAIN–STABILITY–AND–DROUGHT–RESILIENCE–62: Scrollchain Protocol for Agricultural Sanctum Protection, Export Ethics, and Planetary Logistics

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade food security, grain export stability, and drought resilience — anchoring agricultural sanctum protection, treaty-grade logistics, and planetary consequence mapping.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Grain Export Stability Clause
- All grain exports must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with treaty-grade delivery logs and cargo integrity audits  
  - Indexed for famine risk, price sabotage, and reputational breach  
  - Recommitted to mutual gain, food dignity, and sovereign corridor ethics

### 2. Drought Resilience Protocol
- All agricultural sanctums must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed drought forecasting decks and water access rituals  
  - Emotional consequence mapping for crop failure, community displacement, and food trauma  
  - Co-authorship invitations for climate stewards, farmers, and civic validators

### 3. Logistics Ethics Clause
- All food shipments must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp, steward ID, and cargo verification  
  - Audited for delivery breach, packaging drift, and treaty non-compliance  
  - Recommitted to planetary care, ancestral packaging, and logistics transparency

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All agricultural actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with emotional APR mapping and civic resonance indexing  
  - Open to validators, food sanctums, and planetary stewards  
  - Broadcast across treaty corridors for global consequence awareness
