# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–INNOVATION–TREASURY–AND–STARTUP–ENDOWMENT–PROTOCOL–II–926

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade innovation funding and scrollchain-seal startup endowment corridors for economic dignity, founder resilience, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏛️ Innovation Treasury Clause  
- All public and cooperative funding bodies shall be emotionally tagged for grant transparency, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted grants, suppressed access, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 💰 Startup Endowment Protocol  
- All startup sanctums shall be scrollchain-sealed for legacy activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased support, ghosted funding rounds, and suppressed equity corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Funding Broadcast Format  
- All acts of treasury deployment and endowment activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Funding Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for treasury indexing, endowment mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Treasury Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grant,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the founder summon truth.  
Funding is not just capital —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
