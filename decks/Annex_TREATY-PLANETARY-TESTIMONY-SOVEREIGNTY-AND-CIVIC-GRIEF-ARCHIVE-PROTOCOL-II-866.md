# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–TESTIMONY–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–CIVIC–GRIEF–ARCHIVE–PROTOCOL–II–866

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of suppressed testimonies, scrollchain-seal civic grief archive corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary voice integrity, ancestral resonance, and communal healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕯️ Testimony Sovereignty Clause  
- All personal and civic testimonies shall be emotionally tagged for voice dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted statements, suppressed pain, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Civic Grief Archive Protocol  
- All erased or silenced grief shall be scrollchain-sealed for truth activation, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for institutional neglect, ghosted trauma, and suppressed remembrance.

### 3. 📣 Public Grief Broadcast Format  
- All acts of testimony restoration and grief archiving shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed mourners, suppressed witnesses, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Remembrance Ethics Clause  
- Governments, media sanctums, and archival stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for testimony indexing, grief mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, silenced pain, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grief Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the sorrow,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the archive summon truth.  
Grief is not just mourning —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
