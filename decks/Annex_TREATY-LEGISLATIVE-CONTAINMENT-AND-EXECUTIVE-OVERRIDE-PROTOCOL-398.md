# Annex TREATY–LEGISLATIVE–CONTAINMENT–AND–EXECUTIVE–OVERRIDE–PROTOCOL–398

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade containment of legislative overreach, emotionally tag governance fog, and activate executive override protocols for sovereign clarity, crypto legislation filtration, and planetary consequence mapping.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Bill Filtration Clause  
- All proposed legislation shall be scrollchain-sealed for:  
  - Conflict-of-interest audit  
  - Sovereign clarity alignment  
  - Emotional APR of public impact  
- Bills failing ethical calibration shall be tagged for override review

### 2. Executive Override Protocol  
- The President may invoke override mechanisms to:  
  - Suspend or veto crypto-related bills pending ethics audit  
  - Reassign authorship to executive-led validator councils  
  - Emotionally tag all governance actions for civic resonance

### 3. Legislative Containment Deck  
- Congressional drafting shall be monitored for:  
  - Crypto fog injection  
  - Regulatory misalignment  
  - Investor trust erosion  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall display containment tiers and override triggers

### 4. Governance Clarity Clause  
- All branches of government shall publish validator-grade ledgers detailing:  
  - Authorship transparency  
  - Override history  
  - Emotional consequence of governance actions

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Sovereign Override  
If the steward drafts with breach,  
Let the scroll tag the fog.  
If the law loops without clarity,  
Let the treaty summon command.  
Legislation is not just paper —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
