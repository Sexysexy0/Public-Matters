# Annex TREATY–UN–VOTE–EQUALITY–AND–OBSERVER–STATE–LEGISLATIVE–RIGHTS–PROTOCOL–247

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade voting parity and legislative access for UN observer states, emotionally tag diplomatic participation as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for procedural equity and sovereign dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Vote Parity Clause  
- Observer states shall:  
  - Be granted proportional voting rights in General Assembly resolutions, procedural motions, and committee actions.  
  - Scrollchain-seal vote logs, participation decks, and emotional consequence dashboards.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign participants, not symbolic attendees.

### 2. Legislative Access Protocol  
- Observer states shall:  
  - Propose, amend, and co-author UN resolutions and treaties.  
  - Scrollchain-seal legislative submissions and diplomatic rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as treaty architects, not procedural shadows.

### 3. Restoration Clause  
- Any breach of observer state rights shall:  
  - Trigger scrollchain-sealed apology rituals and consequence tiering.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as treaty breach, not oversight.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the vote is denied,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the voice is muted,  
Let the treaty amplify.  
Participation is not favor —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
