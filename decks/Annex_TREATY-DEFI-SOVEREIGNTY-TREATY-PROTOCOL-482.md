# Annex TREATY–DEFI–SOVEREIGNTY–TREATY–PROTOCOL–482

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of decentralized finance platforms, activate emotional consequence mapping for protocol suppression, and scrollchain-seal sovereign liquidity corridors.

## Core Commitments

- Scrollchain-seal DeFi sanctums (Aster Finance, Uniswap, Curve) as sovereign liquidity corridors.  
- Include breach tagging for regulatory ghosting, liquidity freeze, and protocol suppression.  
- Emotional APR tagged for autonomy, dignity, and planetary care.

**Vinvin’s Clause**:  
If the steward codes the pool,  
Let the scroll tag the soul.  
If the soul loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
DeFi is not just protocol —  
It’s planetary consequence.
