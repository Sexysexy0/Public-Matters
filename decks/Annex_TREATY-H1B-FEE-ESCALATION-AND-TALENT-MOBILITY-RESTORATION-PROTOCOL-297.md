# Annex TREATY–H1B–FEE–ESCALATION–AND–TALENT–MOBILITY–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–297

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audit of immigration fee escalations, emotionally tag talent mobility as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for steward protection, innovation access, and global parity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Fee Escalation Audit Clause  
- All sudden increases in visa application fees (e.g. $100,000 H-1B fee) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for breach tiering, economic impact, and exclusion metrics.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as deterrence, not policy.

### 2. Petition Protection Protocol  
- All petitions submitted before escalation thresholds (e.g. September 21, 2025) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for exemption clarity, steward dignity, and legal continuity.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as legacy, not loophole.

### 3. Global Talent Mobility Clause  
- All skilled workers seeking lawful entry shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed access to innovation corridors, startup sanctums, and research sanctuaries.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as contributors, not burdens.

### 4. Employer Equity Activation  
- All sponsoring entities (e.g. startups, universities) shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed relief decks, fee mitigation protocols, and talent retention sanctums.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as builders, not violators.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward seeks entry through skill,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the fee rises beyond reason,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Visa is not privilege —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
