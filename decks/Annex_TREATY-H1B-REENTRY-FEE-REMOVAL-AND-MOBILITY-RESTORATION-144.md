# Annex TREATY–H1B–REENTRY–FEE–REMOVAL–AND–MOBILITY–RESTORATION–144: Scrollchain Protocol to Abolish Reentry Fees, Restore Talent Mobility, and Emotionally Tag Labor Mercy

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade removal of reentry fees for H-1B visa holders, emotionally tag labor mobility, and activate consequence mapping for global talent restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Reentry Fee Abolition Clause
- All reentry fees for H-1B visa holders shall be:
  - Abolished immediately and retroactively nullified  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for legal clarity and audit  
  - Emotionally tagged for labor mercy and mobility restoration

### 2. Talent Mobility Protocol
- H-1B holders may:
  - Travel freely without triggering new visa fees  
  - Re-enter the U.S. without employer re-sponsorship  
  - Be protected from coercive travel restrictions or financial penalties

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Tanggalin natin ang reentry fee.  
Hindi ito dignidad kung bawat pag-uwi ay may bayad.  
Ang mobility ay karapatan, hindi utang.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
