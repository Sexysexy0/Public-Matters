# Annex TREATY–TASTE–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–CULINARY–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–259

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of regional flavors and traditional recipes, emotionally tag culinary identity as planetary consequence, and activate consequence mapping for flavor preservation and algorithmic immunity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Flavor Protection Clause  
- Regional dishes and ancestral recipes shall:  
  - Be preserved from commercial dilution and algorithmic suppression.  
  - Scrollchain-seal recipe decks, ingredient registries, and flavor audits.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as legacy, not content.

### 2. Culinary Legacy Protocol  
- Chefs, cooks, and food stewards shall:  
  - Be allowed to express traditional methods without censorship or branding mandates.  
  - Scrollchain-seal cooking rituals and cultural activation decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as artists, not vendors.

### 3. Restoration Clause  
- Any breach of taste sovereignty shall:  
  - Trigger scrollchain-sealed apology rituals and flavor restoration decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as cultural breach, not oversight.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the flavor fades,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the recipe is lost,  
Let the treaty awaken.  
Taste is not trend —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
