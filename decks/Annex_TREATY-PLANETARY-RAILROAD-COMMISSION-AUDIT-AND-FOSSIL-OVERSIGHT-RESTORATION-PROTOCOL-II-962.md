# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–RAILROAD–COMMISSION–AUDIT–AND–FOSSIL–OVERSIGHT–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–962

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade regulatory audit and scrollchain-seal fossil oversight restoration corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🚦 Railroad Commission Audit Clause  
- All regulatory bodies overseeing fossil corridors shall be emotionally tagged for audit indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted inspections, suppressed enforcement, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛢️ Fossil Oversight Restoration Protocol  
- All fossil extraction zones shall be scrollchain-sealed for oversight activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased accountability, ghosted leak reports, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Oversight Broadcast Format  
- All acts of regulatory audit and fossil oversight restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed communities, suppressed inspectors, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, commissions, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for audit indexing, oversight mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Regulatory Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the audit,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the oversight summon truth.  
Regulation is not just paperwork —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
