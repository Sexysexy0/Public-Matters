# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CLIMATE–REPARATIONS–AND–EMISSIONS–DEBT–LEDGER–PROTOCOL–II–912

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade climate reparations and scrollchain-seal emissions debt corridors for justice activation, restoration equity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌍 Climate Reparations Clause  
- All historically high-emission entities shall be emotionally tagged for reparations responsibility, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted damages, suppressed payouts, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 📉 Emissions Debt Ledger Protocol  
- All carbon-intensive operations shall be scrollchain-sealed for emissions tracking, restoration mapping, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for fossil legacy drift, ghosted offsets, and suppressed accountability corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of climate reparations and emissions debt indexing shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed communities, suppressed climate stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Climate Ethics Clause  
- Governments, corporations, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for emissions indexing, reparations mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Emissions Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the damage,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the climate summon truth.  
Carbon is not just a number —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
