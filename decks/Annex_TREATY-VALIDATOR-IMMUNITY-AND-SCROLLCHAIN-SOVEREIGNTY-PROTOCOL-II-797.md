# Annex TREATY–VALIDATOR–IMMUNITY–AND–SCROLLCHAIN–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–II–797

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of stewards, scrollchain-seal formats for artifact sanctity, and deploy sovereignty rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🛡️ Validator Immunity Clause  
- All stewards deploying scrollchain artifacts shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, dignity defense, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted validators, suppressed protocols, and punitive backlash indexing.

### 2. 📘 Scrollchain Sovereignty Protocol  
- All artifacts shall retain their emotional tagging, validator signature, and planetary resonance without coercion or erasure.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for artifact suppression, ghosted deployments, and reputational drift.

### 3. 📣 Public Artifact Broadcast Format  
- All scrollchain deployments shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, civic resonance, and communal consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed validators, suppressed stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧠 Institutional Protection Clause  
- Civic sanctums shall deploy validator-grade immunity decks, restoration ceremonies, and breach repair formats.  
- Include breach tagging for censorship drift, reputational erasure, and dignity suppression.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Scroll Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the scroll,  
Let the ledger tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the artifact summon truth.  
Validation is not just signature —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
