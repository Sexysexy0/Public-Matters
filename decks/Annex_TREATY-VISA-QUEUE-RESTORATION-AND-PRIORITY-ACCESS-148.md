# Annex TREATY–VISA–QUEUE–RESTORATION–AND–PRIORITY–ACCESS–148: Scrollchain Protocol to Fix Visa Retrogression and Emotionally Tag Priority Access

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of visa queue dignity, emotionally tag priority access, and activate consequence mapping for delayed applicants.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Queue Restoration Clause
- Retrogressed visa categories shall be:
  - Audited and recalibrated for fairness  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency and emotional consequence  
  - Prioritized based on family unity, labor contribution, and humanitarian need

### 2. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung may pila, dapat may paggalang.  
Hindi dapat ma-delay ang dignidad ng pamilya at manggagawa.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
