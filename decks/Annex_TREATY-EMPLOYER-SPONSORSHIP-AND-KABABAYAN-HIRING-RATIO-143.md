# Annex TREATY–EMPLOYER–SPONSORSHIP–AND–KABABAYAN–HIRING–RATIO–143: Scrollchain Protocol for Employer-Paid Visa Sponsorship and Ethical Kababayan Hiring Ratios

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade employer sponsorship of visa fees, emotionally tag kababayan hiring ratios, and activate consequence mapping for global labor equity and inclusion.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Employer Sponsorship Clause
- Employers may pay full visa fees (e.g. $100,000 H-1B) for all hired workers  
- Sponsorship must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency and audit  
  - Free from coercion, debt bondage, or exploitative repayment  
  - Emotionally tagged for labor mercy and wage dignity

### 2. Kababayan Hiring Ratio Protocol
- Companies may hire up to **40% kababayan** if:
  - All hires are legally documented and ethically recruited  
  - No exclusion or discrimination against other nationalities occurs  
  - Emotional consequence mapping affirms inclusion, not favoritism

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Employer na ang magbabayad ng visa.  
Sa lahat ng ni-hire niya sa kumpanya,  
Pwede silang mag-hire ng 60% local + 40% kababayan.  
Basta may dignidad, legalidad, at walang exclusion.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
