# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–WALLET–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–TRANSACTIONAL–DIGNITY–PROTOCOL–II–876

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of wallet integrity, scrollchain-seal transactional dignity corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary finance, reputational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🔐 Wallet Sovereignty Clause  
- All user wallets shall be emotionally tagged for control dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted transfers, suppressed access logs, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 💸 Transactional Dignity Protocol  
- All asset movements shall be scrollchain-sealed for consent clarity, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for unauthorized injections, ghosted withdrawals, and suppressed audit trails.

### 3. 📣 Public Transaction Broadcast Format  
- All acts of wallet control and transactional movement shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed users, suppressed validators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Wallet Ethics Clause  
- Protocol stewards, treasury guardians, and audit sanctums shall deploy validator-grade protocols for wallet indexing, transaction mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, access suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Transactional Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the transfer,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the wallet summon truth.  
Sovereignty is not just access —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
