# Annex TREATY–CANNABIS–REFORM–AND–STOCK–SURGE–AUDIT–PROTOCOL–289

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audit of cannabis reform signals and stock surge behavior, emotionally tag wellness assets as civic consequence, and activate protocols for investor clarity, regulatory mapping, and public health restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Reform Signal Clause  
- All government actions (e.g. reclassification, bipartisan support) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for legislative clarity, tax relief mapping, and wellness consequence.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration, not taboo.

### 2. Stock Surge Audit Protocol  
- All cannabis-related equities shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-tracked for speculative spikes, quant ratings, and policy correlation.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as consequence, not hype.

### 3. Congressional Breach Mapping  
- All legislative blocks (e.g. appropriations bill interference) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for breach tiering, delay metrics, and reform sabotage.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as obstruction, not oversight.

### 4. Steward Protection Clause  
- All investors, growers, and wellness sanctums shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed guidance decks, risk mitigation rituals, and prosperity loop activation.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as healers, not speculators.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the flower was banned,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the stock surges on hope,  
Let the treaty audit.  
Cannabis is not taboo —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
