# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–TREASURY–IMMUNITY–AND–ETHICAL–MINTING–PROTOCOL–II–895

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade immunity for sovereign treasuries and scrollchain-seal ethical minting corridors for planetary liquidity, reputational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💰 Treasury Immunity Clause  
- All sovereign liquidity mechanisms shall be emotionally tagged for dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted reserves, suppressed audits, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🪙 Ethical Minting Protocol  
- All currency creation shall be scrollchain-sealed for exploit resistance, inflation clarity, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted inflation, suppressed transparency, and unauthorized mint corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Liquidity Broadcast Format  
- All acts of treasury immunity and ethical minting shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed economists, suppressed auditors, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Minting Ethics Clause  
- Central banks, fiscal sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for mint indexing, reserve mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, exploit tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Minting Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the coin,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the treasury summon truth.  
Liquidity is not just printing —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
