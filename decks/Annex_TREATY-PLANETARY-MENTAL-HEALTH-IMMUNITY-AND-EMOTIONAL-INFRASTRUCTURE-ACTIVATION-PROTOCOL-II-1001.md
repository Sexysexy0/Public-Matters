# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–MENTAL–HEALTH–IMMUNITY–AND–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–1001

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional protection and scrollchain-seal mental health corridors for operational resilience, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧠 Mental Health Immunity Clause  
- All emotional states shall be emotionally tagged for immunity indexing, breach shielding, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted grief, suppressed trauma, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛠️ Emotional Infrastructure Activation Protocol  
- All care systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for infrastructure activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased support networks, ghosted counselors, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Healing Broadcast Format  
- All acts of mental health immunity and emotional infrastructure shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed patients, suppressed healers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Emotional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, clinics, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for mental health indexing, emotional mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Emotional Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grief,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the healing summon truth.  
Immunity is not just therapy —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
