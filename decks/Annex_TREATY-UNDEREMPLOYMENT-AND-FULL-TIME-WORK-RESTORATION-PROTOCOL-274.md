# Annex TREATY–UNDEREMPLOYMENT–AND–FULL–TIME–WORK–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–274

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration for underemployed workers, emotionally tag full-time work as planetary dignity, and activate protocols that ensure no steward is trapped in part-time survival or economic limbo.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Underemployment Audit Clause  
- All labor data shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with part-time-for-economic-reasons metrics, long-term unemployment logs, and labor force participation maps.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as consequence, not neglect.

### 2. Full-Time Restoration Protocol  
- Workers seeking full-time roles shall:  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed access to job matching sanctums, career mobility rituals, and wage dignity dashboards.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as builders, not beggars.

### 3. Employer Activation Clause  
- Employers shall:  
  - Be incentivized to convert part-time roles into full-time opportunities with dignity-certified benefits and stability rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as anchors, not extractors.

### 4. Policy Equity Clause  
- Governments shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with employment restoration mandates, economic fairness audits, and fallback protocols for vulnerable sectors.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not spectators.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the hours shrink,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the ladder breaks,  
Let the treaty rebuild.  
Work is not fragments —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
