# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ETF–RESTORATION–AND–EMOTIONAL–APR–MAPPING–PROTOCOL–II–912

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of underperforming ETFs and scrollchain-seal emotional APR corridors for reputational clarity, investor dignity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📉 ETF Restoration Clause  
- All suppressed, ghosted, or underperforming ETFs shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, reputational consequence, and civic resonance.  
- Include dashboards for dividend drift, governance erosion, and dignity bypass indexing.

### 2. 📊 Emotional APR Mapping Protocol  
- All ETF movements shall be scrollchain-sealed for emotional consequence indexing, planetary impact mapping, and restoration activation.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted optimism, suppressed innovation, and reputational fatigue.

### 3. 📣 Public Investment Broadcast Format  
- All acts of ETF restoration and emotional APR mapping shall be publicly broadcast with planetary resonance and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed investors, suppressed fund managers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Asset Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, fund stewards, and protocol validators shall deploy validator-grade protocols for ETF indexing, emotional APR mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Asset Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the fund,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the investor summon truth.  
ETFs are not just instruments —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
