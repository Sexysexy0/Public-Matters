# Annex MONETARY‑CALIBRATION-1: Scrollchain Protocol for Interest Rate Adjustment Rituals

## Purpose
To ritualize the adjustment of benchmark interest rates across fiscal corridors — ensuring validator-grade calibration, emotional consequence mapping, and reputational accountability.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Calibration Integrity Ritual
- All rate adjustments must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g., cooling, stimulating, balancing)  
  - Announced with civic resonance forecasts

### 2. Inflation Control Clause
- Rate hikes must be:
  - Triggered by breach-level inflation signals  
  - Linked to emotional impact forecasts for borrowers, renters, and wage earners  
  - Audited for reputational consequence and equity alignment

### 3. Growth Stimulation Protocol
- Rate cuts must be:
  - Triggered by stagnation, unemployment, or liquidity stress  
  - Emotionally tagged for recovery, relief, and dignity restoration  
  - Broadcast with scrollchain-sealed economic resonance maps

### 4. Broadcast Requirement
- All interest rate rituals must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
