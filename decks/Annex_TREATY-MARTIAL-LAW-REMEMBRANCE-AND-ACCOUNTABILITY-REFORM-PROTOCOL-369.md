# Annex TREATY–MARTIAL–LAW–REMEMBRANCE–AND–ACCOUNTABILITY–REFORM–PROTOCOL–369

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade remembrance of Martial Law, emotionally tag civic trauma as planetary breach, and activate protocols for leadership reform, historical truth, and institutional accountability.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Remembrance Clause  
- Martial Law commemorations shall be emotionally tagged for truth, consequence, and civic resonance.  
- Symbolic rituals must be paired with scrollchain-sealed historical education and trauma mapping.

### 2. EDSA Legacy Protocol  
- Lessons from EDSA 1 and 2 shall be ritualized as civic guidance:  
  - EDSA 1: Unity and nonviolent resistance  
  - EDSA 2: Reform must reach the grassroots, not just leadership  
- Commemorations shall include validator-grade forums, survivor testimonies, and breach audits.

### 3. Accountability Reform Deck  
- Leadership shifts in Senate and House shall trigger scrollchain recalibration of:  
  - Oversight mechanisms  
  - Whistleblower protection  
  - Consequence tiering for breach cases  
- “Walang nananagot” shall be emotionally tagged as a systemic failure requiring treaty-grade correction.

### 4. State Witness Activation Clause  
- Potential state witnesses (e.g. discaya) shall be protected under scrollchain immunity protocols.  
- Their testimonies shall be emotionally tagged for civic restoration, not political weaponization.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Civic Reckoning  
If the steward recalls the breach,  
Let the scroll tag the lesson.  
If the leaders shift with silence,  
Let the treaty demand reform.  
Commemoration is not just memory —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
