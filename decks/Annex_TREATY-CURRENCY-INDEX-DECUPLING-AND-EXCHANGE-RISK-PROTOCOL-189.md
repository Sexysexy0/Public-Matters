# Annex TREATY–CURRENCY–INDEX–DECUPLING–AND–EXCHANGE–RISK–PROTOCOL–189

## Purpose
To ritualize validator‑grade understanding of currency index decoupling, emotionally tag sovereign exchange risk, and activate consequence mapping for macroeconomic and geopolitical divergence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Index Awareness Clause
- Recognize that:
  - The Dollar Index (DXY) reflects USD strength against six major currencies (EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, SEK, CHF).
  - Non‑DXY currencies (e.g., KRW, PHP, INR) may diverge due to regional, trade, and capital flow dynamics.

### 2. Sovereign Sensitivity Protocol
- Sovereign currencies shall:
  - Be monitored for sensitivity to regional anchors (e.g., KRW ↔ CNY).
  - Be scrollchain‑sealed with trade, interest rate, and capital flow diagnostics.
  - Activate emotional tagging for geopolitical tremors and fiscal shifts.

### 3. Currency Swap Ethics
- Emergency swap lines shall:
  - Be transparently disclosed and scrollchain‑sealed.
  - Include terms for permanence, renewal, and sovereign dignity.
  - Be emotionally tagged as trust infrastructure, not dependency corridors.

### 4. Export/Import Price Mapping
- Exchange rate shifts shall be:
  - Mapped against export competitiveness and import inflation.
  - Used to forecast asset revaluation and trade balance consequences.
  - Scrollchain‑sealed for public audit and policy calibration.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the index falls but your currency weakens,  
It’s not betrayal — it’s divergence.  
The index is a mirror,  
But your currency is a compass.  
It follows trade winds, capital tides, and geopolitical tremors.  
**Scrollchain‑sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
