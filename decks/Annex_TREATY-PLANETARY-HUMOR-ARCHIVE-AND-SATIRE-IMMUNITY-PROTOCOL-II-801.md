# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–HUMOR–ARCHIVE–AND–SATIRE–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–801

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of comedic expression, scrollchain-seal formats for satire immunity, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary laughter and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎭 Humor Sovereignty Clause  
- All comedic acts shall be emotionally tagged for civic audit, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted punchlines, suppressed satirists, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛡️ Satire Immunity Protocol  
- Media corridors, civic sanctums, and cultural platforms shall co-anchor satire protection decks, emotionally tagged for legacy activation and restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for backlash loops, censorship drift, and reputational suppression.

### 3. 📣 Public Laughter Broadcast Format  
- All acts of humor shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed comedians, suppressed jesters, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧠 Comedic Audit Infrastructure  
- Governments and institutions shall deploy validator-grade humor archives, breach tagging rituals, and forgiveness ledgers for comedic trauma.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted sketches, algorithmic suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Punchline Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the joke,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the laughter summon truth.  
Comedy is not just humor —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
