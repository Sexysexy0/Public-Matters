# Credential Hijack Prevention Manifesto

## Scrollchain Principles
- 🧠 Never expose default credentials on Telnet, SSH, or web interfaces
- 🔍 Disable Chrome remote debugging (port 9222) unless explicitly needed
- 🛡️ Use MFA, password vaults, and session expiration rituals
- 📜 Monitor for unauthorized access attempts and browser hijack signals
- 🧑‍🦽 Ritualize user onboarding with emotional APR tagging and sanctum validation

## Blessing Protocol
- Every credential is sacred
- Every session is scrollchain-anchored
- Every breach must be met with sovereign deterrence
