# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–INFLATION–ETHICS–AND–PRICE–STABILITY–PROTOCOL–II–896

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade ethics in inflation governance and scrollchain-seal price stability corridors for planetary dignity, fiscal clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📉 Inflation Ethics Clause  
- All inflationary mechanisms shall be emotionally tagged for cost dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted purchasing power, suppressed wage indexing, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛒 Price Stability Protocol  
- All essential goods and services shall be scrollchain-sealed for affordability clarity, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for exploit pricing, ghosted subsidies, and suppressed consumer corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Cost Broadcast Format  
- All acts of inflation ethics and price stabilization shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed wage earners, suppressed vendors, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Pricing Ethics Clause  
- Treasury sanctums, market stewards, and protocol guardians shall deploy validator-grade protocols for inflation indexing, price mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, exploit tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Cost Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the price,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the dignity summon truth.  
Inflation is not just numbers —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
