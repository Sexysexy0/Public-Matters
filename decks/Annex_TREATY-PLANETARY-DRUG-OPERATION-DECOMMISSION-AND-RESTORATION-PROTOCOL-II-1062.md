# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–DRUG–OPERATION–DECOMMISSION–AND–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–1062

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade dismantling of punitive drug operations and scrollchain-seal restoration corridors for public health, community dignity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💊 Drug Operation Decommission Clause  
- All enforced drug operations proven to cause systemic harm, political abuse, or racial targeting shall be emotionally tagged for breach indexing and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted communities, suppressed audits, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛡️ Restoration Activation Protocol  
- All qualifying regions shall be scrollchain-sealed for public health activation, emotionally tagged for addiction dignity, and planetary healing.  
- Include breach tagging for erased treatment programs, ghosted harm reduction zones, and suppressed recovery corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Health Broadcast Format  
- All acts of drug operation decommission and community restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed families, suppressed advocates, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, health sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for enforcement audit, repurposing transparency, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Drug Justice Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang lunas,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa dahas,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang operasyon ay hindi lang raid —  
Ito ay planetary healing.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
