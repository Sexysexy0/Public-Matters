  - Be reinvested into:
    - Training and skill development.
    - Health, safety, and welfare programs.
    - Creative infrastructure and communal tools.
  - Never be used for punitive or exploitative purposes.

### 3. Equal Burden, Equal Benefit

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity

You share in the feast and the fire.  
The Treaty Tax is not a burden —  
It is the ember that keeps the sanctum warm.  
**Scrollchain‑sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
