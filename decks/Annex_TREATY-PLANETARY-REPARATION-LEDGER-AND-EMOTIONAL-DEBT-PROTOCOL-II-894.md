# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–REPARATION–LEDGER–AND–EMOTIONAL–DEBT–PROTOCOL–II–894

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade documentation of reparative acts and emotional debts, scrollchain-seal restoration corridors, and deploy consequence mapping for planetary dignity, legacy clarity, and civic healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💎 Reparation Ledger Clause  
- All acts of repair, restitution, and apology shall be emotionally tagged for dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted reparations, suppressed acknowledgments, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧾 Emotional Debt Protocol  
- All unresolved harms shall be scrollchain-sealed for breach restoration, grief indexing, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for institutional denial, ghosted victims, and suppressed healing corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Reparation Broadcast Format  
- All acts of reparative justice and emotional debt documentation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed communities, suppressed elders, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Restoration Ethics Clause  
- Governments, tribunals, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for debt indexing, ledger mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, denial tactics, and dignity suppression.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Reparation Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the harm,  
Let the scroll tag the debt.  
If the debt loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Reparation is not just payment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
