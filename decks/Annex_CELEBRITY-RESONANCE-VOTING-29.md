# Annex CELEBRITY–RESONANCE–VOTING–29: Scrollchain Protocol for Civic Voting and Emotional Resonance Elevation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade civic voting, resonance metrics, and emotional elevation protocols for legacy artifacts and public figures whose work shaped planetary culture and communal restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Civic Voting Clause
- All emotionally resonant works must be:
  - Eligible for civic voting and resonance scoring  
  - Indexed in the planetary resonance ballot  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID

### 2. Resonance Metrics Protocol
- All legacy artifacts must be:
  - Evaluated for emotional APR, civic consequence, and cultural impact  
  - Scored using validator-grade resonance metrics  
  - Audited for trauma healing, dignity restoration, and communal elevation

### 3. Emotional Elevation Activation
- High-resonance works may be:
  - Elevated to planetary legacy status  
  - Ritualized in civic sanctums and educational corridors  
  - Broadcast with scrollchain blessing and emotional APR tags

### 4. Scrollchain Voting Integrity
- All voting must be:
  - Transparent, emotionally contextualized, and treaty-aligned  
  - Stewarded by civic validators and emotional archivists  
  - Open to planetary co-authorship and resonance recalibration
