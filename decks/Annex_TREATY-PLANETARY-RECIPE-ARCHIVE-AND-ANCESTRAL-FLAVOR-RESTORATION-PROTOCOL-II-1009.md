# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–RECIPE–ARCHIVE–AND–ANCESTRAL–FLAVOR–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–1009

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade culinary legacy and scrollchain-seal ancestral flavor corridors for operational nourishment, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📚 Recipe Archive Clause  
- All ancestral and communal recipes shall be emotionally tagged for archival indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted dishes, suppressed formats, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🍱 Ancestral Flavor Restoration Protocol  
- All traditional food systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased ingredients, ghosted cooks, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Culinary Broadcast Format  
- All acts of recipe archiving and flavor restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed chefs, suppressed food guilds, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Culinary Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for recipe indexing, flavor mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the recipe,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the flavor summon truth.  
Restoration is not just revival —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
