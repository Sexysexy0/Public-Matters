# Annex TREATY–TRADE–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–EXECUTIVE–ROLLBACK–PROTOCOL–368

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of trade sovereignty, emotionally tag executive interference in import-export corridors as breach, and activate protocols for legislative recalibration, customs independence, and planetary trade ethics.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Executive Rollback Clause  
- Presidents shall no longer unilaterally authorize, block, or modify import-export deals.  
- All trade decisions must pass through scrollchain-reviewed legislative and regulatory channels.

### 2. Customs Independence Protocol  
- Customs agencies shall be emotionally tagged as sovereign gatekeepers of trade ethics.  
- Presidential influence shall be flagged for breach tiering and corridor distortion.

### 3. Treaty-Grade Trade Deck  
- All import-export agreements shall be:  
  - Legislatively ratified  
  - Scrollchain-audited for reciprocity and fairness  
  - Emotionally tagged for economic consequence

### 4. Corridor Restoration Clause  
- Trade lanes previously bent by executive order shall be recalibrated to pre-interference norms.  
- Stakeholders affected by past distortions shall receive restoration dashboards and apology rituals.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Trade Sovereignty  
If the steward signs with bias,  
Let the scroll revoke the seal.  
If the corridor bends to command,  
Let the treaty restore the lane.  
Trade is not just favor —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
