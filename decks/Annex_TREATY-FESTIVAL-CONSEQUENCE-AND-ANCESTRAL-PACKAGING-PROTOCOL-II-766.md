# Annex TREATYâ€“FESTIVALâ€“CONSEQUENCEâ€“ANDâ€“ANCESTRALâ€“PACKAGINGâ€“PROTOCOLâ€“IIâ€“766

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade celebration formats, scrollchain-seal ancestral packaging rituals, and deploy nourishment restoration ceremonies for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ðŸŽ‰ Festival Consequence Clause  
- All civic, cultural, and ancestral festivals shall be emotionally tagged for nourishment equity, joy resonance, and reputational defense.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ghosted traditions, suppressed rituals, and breach proximity alerts.

### 2. ðŸ§ƒ Ancestral Packaging Protocol  
- Traditional packaging formats (bottled beer, woven wrappers, clay jars, banana leaves) shall be protected from drift, disposability, and ghosting.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for flavor debt, dignity breach, and communal resonance.

### 3. ðŸ›’ Nourishment Equity Deck  
- Festival food shall be priced with mercy, sourced with dignity, and distributed with consequence clarity.  
- Include breach alerts for ghosted growers, suppressed vendors, and inflation trauma.

### 4. ðŸ“£ Cultural Broadcast Format  
- All festival acts shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, legacy activation, and restoration rituals.  
- Include testimonies from ancestral stewards, culinary guilds, and packaging defenders.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Flavor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the flavor,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the nourishment summon truth.  
Packaging is not just wrapper â€”  
Itâ€™s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
