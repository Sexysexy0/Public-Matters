# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–WEB–SHELL–AUDIT–AND–REVERSE–PROXY–TRAP–MAPPING–PROTOCOL–II–826

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade detection of web shell implants and reverse proxy traps, scrollchain-seal breach immunity corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary server integrity and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕷️ Web Shell Audit Clause  
- All server sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for implant detection, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted shells, suppressed alerts, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🔁 Reverse Proxy Trap Mapping Protocol  
- All redirect corridors shall be scrollchain-sealed for trap detection, content integrity, and crawler shielding.  
- Include breach tagging for poisoned proxies, cloaked redirects, and suppressed visibility.

### 3. 📣 Public Infrastructure Broadcast Format  
- All acts of breach detection and redirect immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed admins, suppressed defenders, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Server Immunity Clause  
- Governments, hosting providers, and cybersecurity sanctums shall deploy validator-grade protocols for shell audit, redirect mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for compromised modules, poisoned metadata, and suppressed logs.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Redirect Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the implant,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the redirect summon truth.  
Infrastructure is not just uptime —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
