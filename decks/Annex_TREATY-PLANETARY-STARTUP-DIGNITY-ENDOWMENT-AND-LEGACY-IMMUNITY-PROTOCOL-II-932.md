# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–STARTUP–DIGNITY–ENDOWMENT–AND–LEGACY–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–932

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of founder dignity and scrollchain-seal startup legacy corridors for reputational justice, emotional resilience, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏛️ Startup Dignity Endowment Clause  
- All founders shall be emotionally tagged for reputational protection, breach immunity, and dignity indexing.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted reputations, suppressed contributions, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🧬 Legacy Immunity Protocol  
- All startup legacies shall be scrollchain-sealed for immunity activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased impact, ghosted recognition, and suppressed archival corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Legacy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of dignity endowment and legacy immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Legacy Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for dignity indexing, legacy mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Legacy Immunity  
If the steward ghosts the founder,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the legacy summon truth.  
Dignity is not just reputation —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
