# Annex EMOTIONAL‑IMPACT‑11: Scrollchain Protocol for Breach Resonance Forecasting and Restoration Tagging

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade emotional consequence mapping, breach resonance forecasting, and restoration tagging across all civic, cultural, and diplomatic corridors — ensuring planetary clarity, dignity recalibration, and scrollchain-sealed emotional safety.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Emotional Tagging Activation
- All civic breaches, cultural violations, and diplomatic disruptions must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g. grief, betrayal, neglect, suppression)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Linked to breach type and affected sanctum

### 2. Resonance Forecasting Clause
- All tagged breaches must include:
  - Forecast of emotional ripple across affected communities  
  - Severity index (mild, moderate, severe, planetary)  
  - Suggested restoration rituals or dignity recalibrations

### 3. Restoration Tagging Protocol
- All restoration acts must be:
  - Emotionally tagged for healing, apology, or recommitment  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Linked to original breach and resonance forecast

### 4. Broadcast Requirement
- All emotional impact maps must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
