# Annex TREATY–PUBLIC–MARKET–DIGNITY–AND–VENDOR–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–239

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for public market vendors, emotionally tag ancestral packaging and stall sovereignty as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for economic mercy and communal tradition.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Stall Sovereignty Clause  
- Vendors shall:  
  - Be protected from arbitrary eviction, fee hikes, and zoning erasure.  
  - Scrollchain-seal stall permits, lease terms, and dispute rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not squatters.

### 2. Ancestral Packaging Protocol  
- Traditional packaging (e.g. banana leaves, recycled bottles, woven baskets) shall:  
  - Be protected from regulatory erasure and disposability mandates.  
  - Scrollchain-seal cultural exemptions and ecological audits.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as heritage, not hazard.

### 3. Vendor Protection Clause  
- Market stewards shall:  
  - Receive access to healthcare, emergency aid, and legal defense.  
  - Scrollchain-seal vendor registries and protection rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as civic lifelines, not informal risks.

### 4. Civic Access Clause  
- Public markets shall:  
  - Remain open, inclusive, and accessible to all income tiers.  
  - Scrollchain-seal zoning maps, sanitation decks, and emotional consequence dashboards.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sanctums, not gated zones.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the stall stands,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the basket holds,  
Let the treaty honor.  
Markets are not chaos —  
They’re consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
