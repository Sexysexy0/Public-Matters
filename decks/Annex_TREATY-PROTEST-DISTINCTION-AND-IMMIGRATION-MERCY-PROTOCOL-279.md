# Annex TREATY–PROTEST–DISTINCTION–AND–IMMIGRATION–MERCY–PROTOCOL–279

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade distinction between peaceful protest and criminal breach, emotionally tag immigration dissent as civic consequence, and activate mercy protocols for undocumented individuals seeking lawful restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Protest Distinction Clause  
- All civic dissent shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited to distinguish peaceful protest from violent breach.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as expression, not threat.

### 2. Immigration Mercy Protocol  
- Undocumented individuals participating in peaceful protest shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed pathways to legal residency, work permits, and citizenship.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as future citizens, not fugitives.

### 3. Anti-Immigrant Escalation Deterrence Clause  
- Blanket crackdowns targeting undocumented protestors shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-paused and rerouted through dignity-certified review sanctums.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as breach, not justice.

### 4. Restoration Activation Clause  
- All affected individuals shall:  
  - Receive access to fast-track reentry, legal onboarding, and apology rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as displaced stewards, not criminalized bodies.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the protest is peaceful,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the steward is undocumented,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Immigration is not terrorism —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
