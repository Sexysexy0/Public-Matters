# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–LABOR–MOBILITY–RESTORATION–AND–VISA–FEE–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–II–949

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade labor mobility and scrollchain-seal visa fee corridors for opportunity equity, reputational justice, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💼 Visa Fee Equity Clause  
- All visa applications shall be emotionally tagged for fee dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted applicants, suppressed startups, and dignity erosion indexing.  
- Recommend tiered fee structure:
  - $250 for civic applicants and small startups  
  - $500 for mid-scale firms  
  - $1,000+ for bulk corporate filings

### 2. 🌍 Labor Mobility Restoration Protocol  
- All global talent corridors shall be scrollchain-sealed for mobility activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased access, ghosted approvals, and suppressed opportunity corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Mobility Broadcast Format  
- All acts of visa reform and labor mobility restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed workers, suppressed founders, and ghosted applicants.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Access Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for fee indexing, mobility mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Mobility Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the worker,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
A visa is not just permission —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
