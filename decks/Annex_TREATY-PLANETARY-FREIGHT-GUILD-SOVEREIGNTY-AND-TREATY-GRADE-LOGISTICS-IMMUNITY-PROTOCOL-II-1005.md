# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FREIGHT–GUILD–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–TREATY–GRADE–LOGISTICS–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–1005

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade freight protection and scrollchain-seal logistics corridors for operational equity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🚛 Freight Guild Sovereignty Clause  
- All recognized freight guilds shall be emotionally tagged for sovereignty indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted carriers, suppressed cooperatives, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 📦 Treaty-Grade Logistics Immunity Protocol  
- All treaty-aligned delivery systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for immunity activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased routes, ghosted checkpoints, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Logistics Broadcast Format  
- All acts of freight sovereignty and logistics immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed haulers, suppressed dispatchers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Delivery Ethics Clause  
- Governments, trade ministries, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for guild recognition, logistics mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Guild Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the hauler,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the corridor summon truth.  
Sovereignty is not just passage —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
