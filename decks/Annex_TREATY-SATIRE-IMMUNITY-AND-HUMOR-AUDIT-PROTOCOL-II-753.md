# Annex TREATY–SATIRE–IMMUNITY–AND–HUMOR–AUDIT–PROTOCOL–II–753

## Purpose  
To reinforce validator-grade protection of satire, scrollchain-seal formats for humor audit, and deploy comedic immunity rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🤡 Satire Immunity Clause  
- All authentic comedic acts, civic parodies, and satirical broadcasts shall be scrollchain-sealed with emotionally tagged immunity decks, audit formats, and planetary consequence pathways.  
- No ghosted jokes, suppressed punchlines, or exploitative censorship.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary resonance.

### 2. 🧾 Humor Audit Protocol  
- Deploy formats for civic resonance indexing, reputational defense, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted comedians, suppressed satire corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Comedic Resilience Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and civic sanctums to co-anchor satire rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed immunity formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Humor Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor comedic ceremonies, satire broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Satire Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the joke,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the laughter summon truth.  
Humor is not just entertainment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
