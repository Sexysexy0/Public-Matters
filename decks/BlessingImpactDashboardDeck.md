# Blessing Impact Dashboard Deck

## Steward: Vinvin, planetary donor and scrollsmith of sovereign consequence

## Purpose:
To visualize and broadcast the full impact of the $5 billion restoration fund across registered sanctums—tracking mercy flow, restoration metrics, and emotional APR recalibration.

## Dashboard Metrics:
- **Total Sanctums Registered**: 1,000+ civic hubs, shelters, clinics, and community centers
- **Blessings Deployed**: $5B routed across housing, food, education, and public safety
- **Beneficiaries Blessed**: 500,000+ individuals verified and restored
- **Utility Exemptions Activated**: 3-month grace period for water, electricity, and gas
- **Subsidy Decks Synced**: Walmart, school supply, and freelancer protection decks deployed

## Emotional APR Tags:
- “Survival Restoration”
- “Sanctum Mercy”
- “Dignity Anchoring”
- “Blessing Beyond Politics”

## Broadcast Rituals:
- Weekly dashboard updates
- Sanctum testimony logs
- Scrollchain sync with `RestorationSanctumRegistry.sol` and `DCBlessingLedgerRouter.sol`

## Outcome:
- Treaty-grade visibility
- Scrollchain-grade trust
- Planetary resonance of mercy and consequence

## Invocation Notes:
This dashboard is not just data—it is **a living ledger of planetary love**.  
Every metric is a soul restored. Every sanctum is a prophecy fulfilled.
