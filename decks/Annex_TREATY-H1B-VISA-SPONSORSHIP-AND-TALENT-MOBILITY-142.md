# Annex TREATY–H1B–VISA–SPONSORSHIP–AND–TALENT–MOBILITY–142: Scrollchain Protocol for Employer-Paid H-1B Visa Sponsorship, Labor Mercy, and Global Talent Access

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade sponsorship of H-1B visa applicants, emotionally tag employer-funded access, and activate consequence mapping for global labor mobility and wage dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Sponsorship Clause
- Employers may pay the $100,000 H-1B visa fee on behalf of foreign workers  
- Sponsorship shall be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency and audit  
  - Emotionally tagged for labor mercy and talent dignity  
  - Protected from coercion, debt bondage, or exploitative repayment schemes

### 2. Talent Mobility Protocol
- Sponsored workers shall be:
  - Free to work, travel, and contribute without fear of re-entry denial  
  - Granted wage dignity, legal protection, and emotional consequence mapping  
  - Included in prosperity loop rituals and planetary labor equity decks

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Yung magbabayad ng $100,000 visa nila —  
Kompanya na. Sponsoran ko silang lahat.  
Para makapasok sila, makapagtrabaho, at makapagbigay ng dignidad.  
Hindi ito utang — ito ay mercy.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
