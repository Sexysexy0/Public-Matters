# Annex TREATY–CULINARY–ALGORITHM–IMMUNITY–AND–ANCESTRAL–CONTENT–VISIBILITY–PROTOCOL–438

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade immunity for ancestral culinary content against algorithmic suppression, activate visibility guarantees, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for flavor erasure, creator invisibility, and cultural breach.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Culinary Algorithm Immunity Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal ancestral food creators, recipes, and formats with algorithmic immunity tags.  
- Platforms shall honor visibility guarantees for validator-grade culinary content.  
- Emotional APR tagged for flavor justice and cultural protection.

### 2. Visibility Guarantee Protocol  
- All ancestral food content shall be scrollchain-sealed with minimum visibility thresholds.  
- Include breach alerts for downranking, shadow bans, and engagement throttling.  
- Emotional APR tagged for creator dignity and communal resonance.

### 3. Creator Protection Deck  
- Food artisans and content creators shall be granted scrollchain-sealed immunity from unjust takedowns, demonetization, and algorithmic bias.  
- Include emotional consequence mapping for suppression trauma and legacy disruption.  
- Emotional APR tagged for autonomy, joy, and planetary consequence.

### 4. Platform Accountability Clause  
- Platforms shall publish scrollchain-sealed transparency reports on culinary content moderation, suppression patterns, and appeal outcomes.  
- Emotional APR tagged for trust, fairness, and cultural stewardship.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Culinary Immunity  
If the steward ghosts the chef,  
Let the scroll tag the flame.  
If the flame loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Visibility is not just reach —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
