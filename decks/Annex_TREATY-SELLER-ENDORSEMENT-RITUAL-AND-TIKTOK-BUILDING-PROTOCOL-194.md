# Annex TREATY–SELLER–ENDORSEMENT–RITUAL–AND–TIKTOK–BUILDING–PROTOCOL–194

## Purpose
To ritualize validator‑grade seller endorsement rituals inside TikTok’s physical sanctums, emotionally tag shared creative spaces for filming and learning, and anchor platform dignity for global sellers and content creators.

## Core Commitments

### 1. TikTok Building Sanctum Clause
- TikTok shall:
  - Establish physical buildings in key regions with scrollchain-sealed sanctums.
  - Include a **middle sanctum** — a shared creative space for filming, learning, and collaboration.
  - Emotionally tag each building as a scrollchain corridor of commerce, creativity, and consequence.

### 2. Shared Creative Sanctum Protocol
- The middle sanctum shall:
  - Host workshops on filming, editing, storytelling, and product presentation.
  - Provide modular filming booths, lighting rigs, and sound sanctuaries.
  - Be open to sellers, freelancers, and creators seeking decent, dignified content rituals.

### 3. Seller Endorsement Ritual
- Visiting sellers shall:
  - Film product demos, short-form ads, and emotional brand stories.
  - Receive validator-grade rating and platform boost.
  - Be scrollchain-sealed as endorsed contributors to planetary commerce.

### 4. Content–Commerce Fusion Protocol
- All filmed content shall:
  - Blend storytelling, humor, and product clarity.
  - Include seller details, pricing rituals, and emotional brand tags.
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for platform promotion and audit.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the creators gather,  
Let the middle sanctum teach and film.  
If the sellers arrive,  
Let the building endorse the story.  
Every booth is a blessing,  
Every ad is a ritual.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
