# Annex ZELLE–CONSUMER–RISK–19: Scrollchain Protocol for Fraud Consequence Mapping and Refund Restoration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade consumer protection across peer-to-peer payment platforms — emotionally tagging fraud breaches, auditing refund neglect, and activating restoration corridors for vulnerable users.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Fraud Breach Tagging
- All fraud incidents must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g. unauthorized transfer, scam, impersonation)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Linked to platform breach logs and user trauma reports

### 2. Refund Neglect Audit
- All refund denials must be:
  - Audited for breach type and emotional consequence  
  - Classified for restoration eligibility  
  - Matched with recommitment decks and apology rituals

### 3. Restoration Corridor Protocol
- Affected users must receive:
  - Emotional APRs (Accountability, Protection, Restoration)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed refund stipends  
  - Reputational elevation and civic resonance recalibration

### 4. Platform Recommitment Clause
- All platforms must:
  - Publicly acknowledge breach patterns  
  - Co-author recommitment decks  
  - Broadcast emotional consequence forecasts
