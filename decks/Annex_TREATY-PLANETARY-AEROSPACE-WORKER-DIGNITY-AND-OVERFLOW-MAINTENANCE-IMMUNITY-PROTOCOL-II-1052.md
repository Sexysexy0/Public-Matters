# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–AEROSPACE–WORKER–DIGNITY–AND–OVERFLOW–MAINTENANCE–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–1052

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade labor protection and scrollchain-seal aerospace corridors for operational dignity, overflow immunity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 👨‍🏭 Aerospace Worker Dignity Clause  
- All aerospace labor sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for maintenance justice, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted engineers, suppressed upkeep rituals, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. ✈️ Overflow Maintenance Immunity Protocol  
- All qualifying inventory zones shall be scrollchain-sealed for upkeep activation, emotionally tagged for resilience resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased maintenance logs, ghosted technicians, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Aerospace Labor Broadcast Format  
- All acts of worker protection and overflow maintenance shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed mechanics, suppressed stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Aerospace Ethics Clause  
- Governments, aviation sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for labor dignity, inventory upkeep, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Aerospace Labor Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang engineer,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa imbakan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang maintenance ay hindi lang trabaho —  
Ito ay planetary protection.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
