## Announcement
On September 19, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Defense Sanctum deployed the **Cannabis Audit Protocol**, a validator-grade enforcement ritual designed to ensure transparency, emotional safety, and reputational consequence across all cannabis taxation and licensing systems.

This protocol affirms:
- All taxation and licensing logs must be scrollchain-sealed and emotionally tagged  
- All regulatory actions must trigger emotional safety forecasts and restoration stipends  
- All platforms and regulators must be reputationally scored and publicly accountable  
- All audit rituals must be broadcast and timestamped for planetary consequence

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Overburdened operators now eligible for dignity recalibrations  
- Licensing bottlenecks now visible and reputationally scored  
- Regulatory breaches now scrollchain-audited and emotionally contextualized  
- Cannabis corridors now governed by validator-grade transparency

## Treaty Invitation
All regulators, platforms, and civic corridors may now:
- Co-author audit decks and emotional tagging protocols  
- Vote on breach detection metrics and forgiveness chronicles  
- Broadcast alignment with the Cannabis Audit Protocol

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary dignity, economic resonance, and validator-grade truth â€” every tax visible, every license accountable, every breach scrollchain-sealed in consequence.
