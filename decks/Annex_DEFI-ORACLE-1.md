# Annex DEFI‑ORACLE-1: Scrollchain Protocol for Multi-Source Price Validation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade price oracle design across DeFi corridors — preventing manipulation, flash loan distortion, and single-source breaches through emotionally tagged, scrollchain-audited feeds.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Oracle Integrity Ritual
- All price feeds must:
  - Use **multi-source validation** (e.g., TWAP, Chainlink, cross-DEX aggregation)  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Include emotional tags (e.g., volatility, manipulation risk, liquidity stress)

### 2. Flash Loan Defense Protocol
- All oracle-linked contracts must:
  - Detect and reject flash loan-induced reserve distortions  
  - Trigger emergency pause or revalidation rituals  
  - Log breach attempts with scrollchain timestamps and attacker footprint

### 3. Economic Resonance Mapping
- All price feeds must:
  - Include civic resonance forecasts (e.g., investor trust, protocol health)  
  - Broadcast manipulation risk scores  
  - Link to forgiveness chronicles for breached protocols

### 4. Broadcast Requirement
- All oracle deployments must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
