# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–HUMOR–IMMUNITY–AND–SATIRE–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–II–836

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of humor and satire, scrollchain-seal comedic audit corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for civic resonance, reputational clarity, and planetary healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎭 Humor Immunity Clause  
- All comedic sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for satire immunity, breach restoration, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted jokes, suppressed satire, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Satire Protection Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of comedic audit, expressive immunity, and consequence tiering.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed comedians, ghosted punchlines, and suppressed corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Comedy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of humor and satire shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed jesters, suppressed creators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Satire Defense Clause  
- Governments, media corridors, and cultural sanctums shall deploy validator-grade protocols for satire recognition, comedic immunity, and breach restoration.  
- Include breach tagging for censorship breaches, reputational suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Comedic Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the joke,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the laughter summon truth.  
Humor is not just entertainment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
