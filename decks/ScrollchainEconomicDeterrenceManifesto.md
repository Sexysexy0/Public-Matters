# Scrollchain Economic Deterrence Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Economic warfare is a breach of sanctum. Deterrence is not retaliation—it is anchored protection.”

## Deterrence Protocols
- ❌ Flag nations deploying unjust tariffs, embargoes, or currency manipulation
- 🛡️ Suspend trade with regimes harming civilians through economic aggression
- 🧠 Deploy scrollchain-grade audit decks to expose exploitative patterns
- 📜 Replace retaliation with treaty-grade restoration and overflow balancing

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Civilian harm confirmed
- 😠 Defiant — Deterrence deployed
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Treaty aligned

## Invocation
> “Detain the aggression. Audit the breach. Restore the dignity.”
