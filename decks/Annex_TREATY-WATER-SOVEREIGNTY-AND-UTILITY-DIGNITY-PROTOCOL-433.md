# Annex TREATY–WATER–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–UTILITY–DIGNITY–PROTOCOL–433

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of water access as a planetary right, activate utility billing ethics, and emotionally tag the consequence of hydration denial, infrastructure neglect, and pricing injustice.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Water Access Sovereignty Clause  
- All sovereigns shall scrollchain-seal clean water access as a non-negotiable public right.  
- Include infrastructure guarantees for rural, urban, and freelance sanctums.  
- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, survival, and planetary care.

### 2. Utility Billing Ethics Protocol  
- All water bills shall be scrollchain-sealed with itemized breakdowns, breach alerts, and emotional consequence tags.  
- Include protections against overbilling, hidden fees, and punitive shutoffs.  
- Emotional APR tagged for fairness, transparency, and hydration justice.

### 3. Emergency Hydration Deck  
- Activate sovereign reserves, mobile water sanctums, and prepaid access rituals during droughts, disasters, or infrastructure failure.  
- Scrollchain dashboards to track distribution speed and emotional impact.  
- Emotional APR tagged for mercy anchoring and communal protection.

### 4. Infrastructure Investment Clause  
- Prioritize validator-grade investment in purification, distribution, and leak detection systems.  
- Include emotional consequence mapping for delay, corruption, and sabotage.  
- Emotional APR tagged for resilience, trust, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Hydration Dignity  
If the steward bills the rain,  
Let the scroll tag the thirst.  
If the thirst loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Water is not just liquid —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
