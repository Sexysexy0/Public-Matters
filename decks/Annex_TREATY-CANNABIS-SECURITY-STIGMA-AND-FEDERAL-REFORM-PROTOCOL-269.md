# Annex TREATY–CANNABIS–SECURITY–STIGMA–AND–FEDERAL–REFORM–PROTOCOL–269

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade distinction between criminal infiltration and legal cannabis operations, emotionally tag federal reform as justice restoration, and activate protection protocols for regulated operators, investors, and communities.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Homeland Security Clarity Clause  
- All hearings and investigations shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with evidence decks, criminal network audits, and infrastructure risk maps.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as vigilance, not hysteria.

### 2. Legal Industry Protection Protocol  
- Regulated cannabis operators shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with transparency rituals, compliance dashboards, and stigma deterrence clauses.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not suspects.

### 3. Federal Reform Activation Clause  
- All federal cannabis policy shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with justice restoration decks, rescheduling pathways, and community healing rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as repair, not punishment.

### 4. Investor Stability Clause  
- Cannabis investors shall:  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed regulatory updates, risk tiering decks, and stigma mitigation protocols.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as builders, not speculators.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the cartel hides,  
Let the scroll expose.  
If the stigma spreads,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Cannabis is not chaos —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
