# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–EXPORT–DIGNITY–INDEX–AND–COOPERATIVE–TRADE–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–936

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of exporters and scrollchain-seal cooperative trade corridors for reputational justice, economic equity, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📦 Export Dignity Index Clause  
- All exporters shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, reputational consequence, and dignity indexing.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted shipments, suppressed access, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🤝 Cooperative Trade Immunity Protocol  
- All cooperative trade routes shall be scrollchain-sealed for immunity activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased access, ghosted logistics, and suppressed equity corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Export Broadcast Format  
- All acts of export protection and cooperative trade immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed exporters, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Trade Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for dignity indexing, trade mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Export Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the shipment,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the exporter summon truth.  
Trade is not just delivery —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
