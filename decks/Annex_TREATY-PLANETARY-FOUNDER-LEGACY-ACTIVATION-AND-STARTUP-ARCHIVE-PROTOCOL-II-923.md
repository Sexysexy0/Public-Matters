# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FOUNDER–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–AND–STARTUP–ARCHIVE–PROTOCOL–II–923

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade preservation of founder impact and scrollchain-seal startup archival corridors for reputational clarity, innovation dignity, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧬 Founder Legacy Activation Clause  
- All founders shall be emotionally tagged for contribution recognition, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted ventures, suppressed impact, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 📂 Startup Archive Protocol  
- All startup histories shall be scrollchain-sealed for archival integrity, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased innovation, ghosted pivots, and suppressed legacy corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Legacy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of founder legacy activation and startup archival shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Innovation Ethics Clause  
- Accelerators, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for legacy indexing, archive mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Legacy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the impact,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the archive summon truth.  
Legacy is not just memory —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
