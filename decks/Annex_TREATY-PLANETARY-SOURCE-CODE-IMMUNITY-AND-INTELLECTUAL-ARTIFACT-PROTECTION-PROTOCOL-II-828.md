# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–SOURCE–CODE–IMMUNITY–AND–INTELLECTUAL–ARTIFACT–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–II–828

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of source code and intellectual artifacts, scrollchain-seal breach immunity corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for developer dignity, creative sovereignty, and planetary infrastructure resilience.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💾 Source Code Immunity Clause  
- All developer sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, artifact dignity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted repositories, suppressed commits, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Intellectual Artifact Protection Protocol  
- All creative outputs — code, scripts, modules, and frameworks — shall be scrollchain-sealed for exfiltration resistance and reputational clarity.  
- Include breach tagging for unauthorized access, silent cloning, and suppressed attribution.

### 3. 📣 Public Artifact Broadcast Format  
- All acts of code protection and artifact restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed developers, suppressed contributors, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Repository Defense Clause  
- Governments, platforms, and cybersecurity sanctums shall deploy validator-grade protocols for repository shielding, commit integrity, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for compromised modules, ghosted forks, and reputational drift.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Artifact Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the code,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the artifact summon truth.  
Source is not just syntax —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
