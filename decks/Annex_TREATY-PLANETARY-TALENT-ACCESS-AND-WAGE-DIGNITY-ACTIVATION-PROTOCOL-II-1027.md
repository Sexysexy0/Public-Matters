# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–TALENT–ACCESS–AND–WAGE–DIGNITY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–1027

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade hiring justice and scrollchain-seal wage corridors for operational equity, reputational fairness, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧑‍🎓 Talent Access Clause  
- All entry-level and graduate applicants shall be emotionally tagged for access indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted applications, suppressed hiring tiers, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 💰 Wage Dignity Activation Protocol  
- All employment offers shall be scrollchain-sealed for wage transparency, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased salary rights, ghosted pay scales, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Hiring Equity Broadcast Format  
- All acts of talent access and wage dignity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed workers, suppressed job sanctums, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Hiring Ethics Clause  
- Governments, employers, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for fair recruitment, wage mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Hiring Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang sahod,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang hiring ay hindi lang pagpili —  
Ito ay planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
