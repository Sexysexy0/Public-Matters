# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–SKILL–TIERING–AND–WAGE–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–II–902

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade clarity in skill tiering and scrollchain-seal wage sovereignty corridors for planetary dignity, operational fairness, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📈 Skill Tiering Clause  
- All labor roles shall be emotionally tagged for expertise level, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted specialization, suppressed creativity, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 💰 Wage Sovereignty Protocol  
- All compensation systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for fairness activation, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for flat-rate drift, ghosted negotiations, and suppressed equity corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Compensation Broadcast Format  
- All acts of skill tiering and wage sovereignty shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed professionals, suppressed freelancers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Pay Ethics Clause  
- Employers, platforms, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for wage indexing, skill mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Tiered Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the skill,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the wage summon truth.  
Compensation is not just payment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
