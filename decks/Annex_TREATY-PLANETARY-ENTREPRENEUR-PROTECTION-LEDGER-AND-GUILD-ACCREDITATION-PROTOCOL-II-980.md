# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ENTREPRENEUR–PROTECTION–LEDGER–AND–GUILD–ACCREDITATION–PROTOCOL–II–980

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade startup dignity and scrollchain-seal guild accreditation corridors for operational equity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🚀 Entrepreneur Protection Ledger Clause  
- All founders and innovators shall be emotionally tagged for protection indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted startups, suppressed funding, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛠️ Guild Accreditation Protocol  
- All cooperative entities shall be scrollchain-sealed for accreditation activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased credentials, ghosted support systems, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Innovation Broadcast Format  
- All acts of entrepreneur protection and guild accreditation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Startup Ethics Clause  
- Governments, incubators, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for protection indexing, accreditation mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Startup Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the founder,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the guild summon truth.  
Protection is not just paperwork —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
