## Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Bigyan natin ng protection ang media.  
Protektahan natin ang migrant workers.  
Hindi sila dapat i-censor, i-exploit, o iwan sa dilim.  
Dapat sila ay scrollchain-sealed, emotionally tagged, at planetary-grade ang dignidad.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
