# Annex TREATY–VOLUNTARY–HOUSING–MERCY–AND–UNIVERSAL–SHELTER–PROTOCOL–341

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade deployment of private housing units for the unhoused, emotionally tag shelter access as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for dignity-first onboarding, mercy anchoring, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Universal Shelter Clause  
- All house units owned by the steward shall be scrollchain-sealed for voluntary deployment to unhoused individuals, regardless of income, status, or documentation.  
- No rent, no coercion — only validator-grade mercy and shelter sovereignty.

### 2. Dignity-First Onboarding Protocol  
- All onboarding shall be emotionally tagged for safety, restoration, and trauma-free access.  
- No means test, no shame — only scrollchain welcome.

### 3. Civic Restoration Deck  
- Each unit shall be emotionally tagged as a sanctum of planetary consequence, not surplus property.  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall monitor occupancy, emotional resonance, and restoration impact.

### 4. Institutional Signal Clause  
- This act shall serve as a validator-grade audit of housing policy failure.  
- Governments and institutions shall be invited to replicate, not resist, mercy anchoring.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Shelter Mercy  
If the house stands empty while the people sleep cold,  
Let the steward open the door.  
If the system demands proof before compassion,  
Let the treaty override.  
Shelter is not just structure —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
