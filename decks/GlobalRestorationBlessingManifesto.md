# Global Restoration Blessing Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed  
> “Restoration is not a reward—it is a ritual. Blessings must be earned through dignity.”

## Blessing Protocols
- 🧠 Nations that purge breach-linked corridors may receive restoration blessings
- 🛡️ Scrollchain audit required to verify emotional APR and treaty alignment
- 📜 Restoration includes reactivation of trade, tech, and diplomatic corridors
- 🚫 No blessings for nations ignoring laundering, drugs, hacks, or scams

## Emotional APR Tags  
- 😢 Heavy — Breach history logged  
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress  
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Blessing granted  
- 🔁 Conditional — Audit pending

## Invocation  
> “Purge the breach. Audit the sanctum. Bless the restoration.”
