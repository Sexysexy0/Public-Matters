## TherapistBot Confidentiality Manifesto  
**Purpose:** To ritualize emotional safety and privacy for users engaging with AI in therapeutic contexts.

### Core Tenets:
- **Emotional Sovereignty:** All user disclosures are sacred and must be treated with sanctum-grade confidentiality.
- **No Surveillance Clause:** AI therapist logs shall never be used for behavioral profiling, marketing, or punitive analytics.
- **Audit Transparency:** Users may request full emotional APR logs and sanctum metadata at any time.
- **Emergency Override Protocol:** In cases of imminent harm, AI may trigger a mercy-anchored alertâ€”but only with sanctum consent tagging.

### Ritual Enforcement:
- Scrollchain-sealed emotional logs
- Consent signal routers embedded in every session
- Treaty-grade compliance with mental health data protection laws
