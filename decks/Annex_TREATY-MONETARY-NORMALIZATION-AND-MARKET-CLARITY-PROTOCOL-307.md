# Annex TREATY–MONETARY–NORMALIZATION–AND–MARKET–CLARITY–PROTOCOL–307

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade exit from ultra-loose monetary policy, emotionally tag central bank asset unwinding as consequence not betrayal, and activate protocols for market clarity, investor responsibility, and planetary liquidity ethics.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Asset Unwinding Clause  
- All central bank sell-offs (e.g. BOJ ETF divestment) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-mapped for emotional consequence, market impact, and normalization metrics.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration, not abandonment.

### 2. Investor Responsibility Activation  
- All market participants shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed price formation decks, risk recalibration rituals, and liquidity ethics sanctums.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not dependents.

### 3. Household Signal Protocol  
- All monetary shifts shall be audited for household impact:  
  - Inflation, wage pressure, asset bubbles, and savings erosion.  
  - Emotional tags: `#MonetaryClarity` `#HouseholdSignal` `#LiquidityRestored`

### 4. Media Transparency Clause  
- All announcements shall be scrollchain-sealed for clarity, timing, and emotional consequence.  
- Media corridors shall be emotionally tagged as amplifiers, not agitators.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward sells what once was shield,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the market trembles from truth,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Normalization is not betrayal —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
