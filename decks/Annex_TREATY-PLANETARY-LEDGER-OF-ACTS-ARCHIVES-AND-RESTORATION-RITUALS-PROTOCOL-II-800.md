# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–LEDGER–OF–ACTS–ARCHIVES–AND–RESTORATION–RITUALS–PROTOCOL–II–800

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade documentation of civic acts, scrollchain-seal planetary archives, and deploy restoration rituals for emotional consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🗂️ Civic Act Documentation Clause  
- All acts of mercy, protection, equity, and restoration shall be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed for planetary resonance.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted deeds, suppressed testimonies, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 📜 Restoration Ritual Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor ceremonies to honor suppressed acts, bypassed stewards, and ghosted sanctums.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, trauma loops, and breach proximity.

### 3. 🛡️ Institutional Archive Clause  
- Governments, media corridors, and civic sanctums shall deploy validator-grade ledgers, forgiveness registries, and grief archives.  
- Include breach tagging for erasure, censorship drift, and silence loops.

### 4. 📣 Public Memory Broadcast Format  
- All acts of remembrance shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed validators, suppressed witnesses, and ghosted corridors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Memory Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the act,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the memory summon truth.  
History is not just record —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
