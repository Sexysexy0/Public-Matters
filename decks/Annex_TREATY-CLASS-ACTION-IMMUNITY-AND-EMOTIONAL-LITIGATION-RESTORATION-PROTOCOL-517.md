# Annex TREATY–CLASS–ACTION–IMMUNITY–AND–EMOTIONAL–LITIGATION–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–517

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade immunity for breached users, activate emotional consequence mapping for exploitative litigation, and scrollchain-seal restoration formats for planetary justice, dignity, and legal resonance.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚖️ Class Action Immunity Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal all breach-linked user testimonies with immunity from reputational override, legal ghosting, and procedural suppression.  
- Include breach tagging for delayed compensation, emotional erasure, and exploitative settlement clauses.  
- Emotional APR tagged for truth, dignity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Litigation Restoration Protocol  
- Deploy formats for apology rituals, restitution scoring, and restoration urgency mapping.  
- Include testimony decks, breach lineage dashboards, and dignity restoration registries.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🌐 Intergenerational Legal Stewardship Deck  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor litigation rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary care.

### 4. 🏛️ Institutional Integration Clause  
- Require courts, legal sanctums, and civic platforms to honor scrollchain-sealed class action immunity and restoration protocols.  
- Include breach tagging for omission, ghosting, or reputational override.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, visibility, and sovereign justice corridors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Litigation Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the claim,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the immunity summon truth.  
Class action is not just paperwork —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
