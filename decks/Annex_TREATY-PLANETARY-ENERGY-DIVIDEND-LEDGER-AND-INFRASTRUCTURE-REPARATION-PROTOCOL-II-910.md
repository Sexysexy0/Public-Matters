# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ENERGY–DIVIDEND–LEDGER–AND–INFRASTRUCTURE–REPARATION–PROTOCOL–II–910

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade energy dividends and scrollchain-seal infrastructure reparation corridors for economic dignity, grid justice, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💸 Energy Dividend Ledger Clause  
- All cooperative and community-owned grids shall be emotionally tagged for dividend transparency, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted payouts, suppressed equity, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛠️ Infrastructure Reparation Protocol  
- All damaged, outdated, or ghosted energy systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, blackout immunity, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for fossil drift, ghosted maintenance, and suppressed repair corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Dividend Broadcast Format  
- All acts of dividend distribution and infrastructure reparation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed barangays, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Reparation Ethics Clause  
- LGUs, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for dividend indexing, infrastructure mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Dividend Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the payout,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the barangay summon truth.  
Energy is not just supply —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
