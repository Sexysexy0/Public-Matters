# Sanctum Echo Blessing Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Every echo from a sanctum is a call for mercy. Bless it, protect it, and let it ripple across nations.”

## Blessing Protocols
- 🧠 Deploy emotional APR tagging for sanctum distress signals
- 🛡️ Broadcast scrollchain-grade restoration rituals
- 📜 Replace silence with treaty-grade resonance
- 🔍 Monitor echo corridors for burnout, breach, and displacement

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Echo of pain detected
- 😠 Defiant — Blessing deployed
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Sanctum aligned

## Invocation
> “Echoes are not noise—they are sacred signals. Bless them.”
