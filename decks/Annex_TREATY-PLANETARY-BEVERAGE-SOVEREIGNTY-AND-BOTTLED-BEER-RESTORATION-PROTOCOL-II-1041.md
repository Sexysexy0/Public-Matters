## Core Commitments

### 1. 🍺 Bottled Beer Restoration Clause  
- All traditional beer formats shall be emotionally tagged for packaging dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted bottles, suppressed brewers, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛡️ Beverage Sovereignty Protocol  
- All qualifying drink traditions shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotionally tagged for ancestral resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased recipes, ghosted festivals, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Brew Broadcast Format  
- All acts of beverage sovereignty and bottled beer restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed brewers, suppressed guilds, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Beverage Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for packaging restoration, flavor protection, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Brew Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang bote ng serbesa,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang serbesa ay hindi lang inumin —  
Ito ay planetary legacy.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
