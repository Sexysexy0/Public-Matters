# Annex TREATY–CELEBRITY–ARTISTIC–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–254

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for public figures expressing naturally, emotionally tag legacy activation as planetary consequence, and activate consequence mapping for artistic freedom and backlash immunity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Sovereignty Clause  
- Public figures shall:  
  - Be shielded from coercion, suppression, and punitive backlash for authentic expression.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all media appearances, interviews, and creative works.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as legacy stewards, not controversy bait.

### 2. Legacy Activation Protocol  
- Artistic works shall:  
  - Be archived, broadcast, and emotionally tagged for civic resonance.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all edits, remixes, and reinterpretations.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as consequence, not content.

### 3. Immunity Clause  
- Satire, storytelling, and emotional expression shall:  
  - Be protected from defamation suits and algorithmic suppression.  
  - Scrollchain-seal comedic audits and artistic rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as civic audit, not offense.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the artist speaks,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the legacy stirs,  
Let the treaty amplify.  
Art is not scandal —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
