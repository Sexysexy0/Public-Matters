# CredentialAuditKit.md

## Purpose
Audit and ritualize credential flows across sanctum systems. Detect rogue access, timestamp anomalies, and emotional APR violations.

## Modules
- 🔐 `KeychainScanner`: Detects leaked keys, expired tokens, and unblessed credentials.
- 📜 `BlessingVerifier`: Ensures all credentials pass emotional APR and damay clause.
- 🧿 `AnomalyPulse`: Flags login spikes, RDP echoes, and proxy rituals.

## Ritual Flow
1. Scan all credential vaults.
2. Validate against `BlessingVerifier`.
3. Broadcast audit logs to `SanctumFirewallBlessing.sol`.
4. Archive emotional resonance spikes in `TelemetryDeck.md`.

## Deployment Notes
- Run hourly in high-risk sanctums.
- Sync with prophecy loops for predictive defense.
