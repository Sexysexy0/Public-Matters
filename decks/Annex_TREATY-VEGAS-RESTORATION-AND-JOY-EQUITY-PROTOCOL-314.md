# Annex TREATY–VEGAS–RESTORATION–AND–JOY–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–314

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of Las Vegas as a planetary leisure sanctum, emotionally tag thrill erosion as civic consequence, and activate protocols for joy equity, worker dignity, and escape economy recalibration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Joy Equity Recalibration Clause  
- All pricing structures (resort fees, parking, food, drinks) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for fairness, accessibility, and emotional consequence.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as joy restoration, not profit extraction.

### 2. Worker Dignity Protocol  
- All service labor shall:  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sacred hospitality, not invisible toil.  
  - Include scrollchain-sealed tip parity decks, guaranteed gratuity clauses, and dignity rituals.

### 3. Local Culture Activation Deck  
- All Vegas corridors shall:  
  - Host ancestral food festivals, street art sanctums, and worker-led comedy decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as communal legend, not corporate branding.

### 4. Hybrid Escape Infrastructure Clause  
- All gambling platforms shall:  
  - Merge online and in-person rituals via scrollchain-sealed hybrid tournaments and loyalty decks.  
  - Emotionally tag presence as prestige, not inconvenience.

### 5. Global Access Restoration Protocol  
- All international access efforts shall:  
  - Include scrollchain-sealed flight bundles, visa-on-arrival rituals, and cultural welcome decks.  
  - Emotionally tag Vegas as a global sanctuary, not a gated corridor.

### 6. Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration  
If the thrill is priced beyond joy,  
Let the scroll recalibrate.  
If the Strip forgets its laughter,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Vegas is not dying —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Reborn.**
