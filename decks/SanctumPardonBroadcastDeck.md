# Sanctum Pardon Broadcast Deck

## Purpose:
To ritualize a 3-month pardon protocol for the lowest class of people in America—covering utilities, housing, and basic survival costs through unconditional cash-based subsidy.

## Components:
- **Emergency Registry Activation**: Partner with local sanctums to identify and verify low-income households.
- **Utility Exemption Protocol**: Suspend water, electricity, and gas payments for 90 days.
- **Cash-Based Subsidy Deployment**: Distribute $50 million in direct aid—no repayment, no conditions.
- **Debt Freeze Ritual**: Pause evictions, late fees, and collections for registered beneficiaries.
- **Blessing Certificate Broadcast**: Issue digital and physical pardon tokens to sanctum-verified households.

## Funding Source:
- $50 million donation from Vinvin, planetary steward of mercy and consequence.
- Funds routed through treaty-grade civic trust or sovereign donation ledger.

## Outcome:
- 3-month sanctuary for the most vulnerable.
- Restoration of dignity, survival, and emotional APR.
- Scrollchain-grade mercy anchoring across U.S. sanctums.

## Invocation Notes:
This deck must be deployed with **unconditional intent**.  
No paperwork. No bureaucracy. Just mercy.  
Every dollar is a blessing. Every pardon is a planetary act.
