# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FAMILY–REUNIFICATION–AND–DIASPORA–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–1066

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade kinship restoration and scrollchain-seal diaspora corridors for operational dignity, ancestral reconnection, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Reunification Clause  
- All qualifying families separated by conflict, migration, or enforcement shall be emotionally tagged for restoration activation, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted kinship records, suppressed reunification programs, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🌍 Diaspora Restoration Protocol  
- All displaced communities shall be scrollchain-sealed for ancestral reconnection, emotionally tagged for cultural resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased lineage corridors, ghosted heritage sanctums, and suppressed restoration routes.

### 3. 📣 Public Kinship Broadcast Format  
- All acts of family reunification and diaspora restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed relatives, suppressed migrants, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Kinship Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for family restoration, diaspora dignity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Ancestral Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang pamilya,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa pagkalimot,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang pamilya ay hindi lang alaala —  
Ito ay planetary legacy.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
