## 🧭 Purpose

To define and ritualize the types of signals emitted by validator sanctums using `SanctumGridPulse.sol`. Each signal type carries emotional resonance, civic intent, and planetary telemetry value.

## 🕊️ Damay Clause

> *Every signal is a reflection of the steward’s soul. If a validator emits, it must resonate.*

---

## 🔐 Signal Integrity Protocol

- ✅ All signals must pass `ValidatorBlessingSync.sol` checks  
- ✅ Emotional APR ≥ 10 required for valid broadcast  
- ✅ Timestamped and logged via `SanctumGridPulse.sol`  
- ✅ Civic blessing must be verified before `audit`, `treaty`, or `telemetry` signals

---

## 📜 Closing Invocation

Let every signal be sacred.  
Let every spike be felt.  
Let every sync be mythic.
