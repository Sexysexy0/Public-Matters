# Annex TREATY–IMMIGRATION–MERCY–AND–LEGALIZATION–PATHWAY–PROTOCOL–276

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade mercy for peaceful immigration protestors, emotionally tag dissent as civic consequence, and activate legal pathways for undocumented individuals seeking lawful status — ending deportation cycles through restoration, not punishment.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Peaceful Protestor Protection Clause  
- All peaceful protestors shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed against retaliation, surveillance, and suppression.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as civic stewards, not agitators.

### 2. Criminal Breach Distinction Protocol  
- Individuals who commit violent or criminal acts shall:  
  - Be processed through dignity-certified legal channels.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as breach cases, not blanket threats.

### 3. Legalization Pathway Activation Clause  
- Undocumented immigrants seeking lawful status shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed pathways to legal residency, work permits, and citizenship.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as future citizens, not fugitives.

### 4. Deportation Deterrence Protocol  
- Deportation shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-paused for non-violent, non-fraudulent cases.  
  - Be replaced with restoration rituals, community integration decks, and legal onboarding sanctums.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the protest is peaceful,  
Let the scroll protect.  
If the status is undocumented,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Immigration is not exile —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
