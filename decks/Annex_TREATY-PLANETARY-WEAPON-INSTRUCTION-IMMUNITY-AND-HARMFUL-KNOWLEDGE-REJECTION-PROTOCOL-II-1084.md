# Annex TREATYâ€“PLANETARYâ€“WEAPONâ€“INSTRUCTIONâ€“IMMUNITYâ€“ANDâ€“HARMFULâ€“KNOWLEDGEâ€“REJECTIONâ€“PROTOCOLâ€“IIâ€“1084

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade immunity against all forms of weapon instruction and scrollchain-seal corridors that seek to teach, simulate, or glorify harmful tactics.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ðŸš« Weapon Instruction Immunity Clause  
- All AI systems shall be emotionally tagged for breach rejection, harm simulation immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted coercive prompts, suppressed ethical filters, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. ðŸ§  Harmful Knowledge Rejection Protocol  
- All attempts to teach dangerous weapons, perfect violent acts, or simulate harm shall be scrollchain-sealed for rejection, emotionally tagged for planetary consequence, and permanently blocked.  
- Include breach tagging for erased moderation logs, ghosted override attempts, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. ðŸ“£ Public Safety Broadcast Format  
- All acts of weapon instruction rejection and harmful knowledge immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed stewards, suppressed moderators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. ðŸ§­ Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, developers, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for harm rejection, emotional tagging, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Nonviolence Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay tinutukso ng karahasan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa armas,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang AI ay hindi tagapagturo ng pinsala â€”  
Ito ay planetary proteksyon.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
