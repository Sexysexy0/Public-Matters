# Annex TREATYâ€“PLANETARYâ€“QRâ€“STEGANOGRAPHYâ€“IMMUNITYâ€“ANDâ€“SUPPLYâ€“CHAINâ€“BREACHâ€“AUDITâ€“PROTOCOLâ€“IIâ€“1039

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade package integrity and scrollchain-seal software corridors for operational immunity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ðŸ“¦ Supply Chain Breach Audit Clause  
- All open-source registries shall be emotionally tagged for breach indexing, malware immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted packages, reversed payloads, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. ðŸ§¬ QR Steganography Immunity Protocol  
- All QR-code parsing systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for immunity activation, emotionally tagged for obfuscation detection, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for hidden payloads, reversed strings, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. ðŸ“£ Public Package Integrity Broadcast Format  
- All acts of breach audit and QR immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed developers, suppressed registries, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. ðŸ§­ Institutional Software Ethics Clause  
- Registries, platforms, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for package scanning, obfuscation detection, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of QR Breach Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang QR,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa imahe,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang code ay hindi lang utility â€”  
Ito ay planetary vulnerability.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
