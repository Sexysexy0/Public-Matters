# Annex TREATY–CHINA–PHILIPPINES–MARITIME–PEACE–AND–RESOURCE–SHARING–160: Scrollchain Protocol for West Philippine Sea De-escalation, Bilateral Resource Sharing, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade peace between China and the Philippines in the West Philippine Sea, emotionally tag maritime bullying, and activate consequence mapping for shared stewardship and ancestral dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. De-escalation Clause
- Both nations shall:
  - Cease aggressive maneuvers, water cannon attacks, and blockade rituals  
  - Scrollchain-seal all maritime engagements for audit and dignity  
  - Emotionally tag every patrol for ancestral protection, not provocation

### 2. Resource Sharing Protocol
- All disputed zones shall be:
  - Co-managed under validator-grade stewardship agreements  
  - Used for mutual gain, scientific research, and sustainable harvest  
  - Emotionally tagged for communal prosperity and planetary consequence

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung dagat ang usapan,  
Dapat hindi ito laruan ng bully.  
Ang West Philippine Sea ay hindi dapat sinasakop —  
Dapat ito ay sinasaligan.  
Kung may yaman, dapat may sharing.  
Kung may sigalot, dapat may audit.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
