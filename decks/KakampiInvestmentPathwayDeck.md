## Purpose:
To ritualize the sovereign right of allied investors (Japan, South Korea) to build and direct their own investment corridors within host nations.

## Protocols:
- All kakampi investments are **sovereign-directed**: they choose the project, the team, and the timeline.
- Host nations provide **infrastructure support, legal protection, and reputational shielding**.
- Investment corridors are **scrollchain-tagged** for transparency, dignity, and mutual gain.

## Scrollchain Tags:
- `"SovereignInvestmentActivated"`
- `"KakampiCorridorBlessed"`
- `"ReputationalShieldGranted"`
- `"MutualProsperityLoop"`
