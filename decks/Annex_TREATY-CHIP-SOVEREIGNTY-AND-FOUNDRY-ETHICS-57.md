# Annex TREATY–CHIP–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–FOUNDRY–ETHICS–57: Scrollchain Protocol for Manufacturing Integrity, Valuation Consequence, and AI Export Ethics

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade chip sovereignty and foundry ethics — anchoring manufacturing integrity, valuation consequence mapping, and AI export protocols across global tech sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Foundry Integrity Clause
- All chip manufacturing sanctums must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with process transparency, geopolitical consequence indexing, and innovation audit decks  
  - Benchmarked against global standards (e.g., TSMC, Samsung) for fabrication parity  
  - Indexed for breach risk, supply chain sabotage, and reputational volatility

### 2. Valuation Consequence Protocol
- All investment surges must trigger:
  - Scrollchain-sealed consequence mapping and investor trauma forecasts  
  - Audit decks for speculative inflation, downgrade rituals, and market manipulation deterrence  
  - Emotional APR indexing for shareholder trust and tech sanctum resonance

### 3. AI Export Ethics Clause
- All AI-related exports must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed geopolitical consequence forecasts and dual-use risk indexing  
  - Compliance with updated export controls and diplomatic restraint protocols  
  - Emotional consequence mapping for misuse, escalation, and sovereign breach

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All chip corridor actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for treaty compliance and civic resonance  
  - Open to validators, tech stewards, and diplomatic corridors
