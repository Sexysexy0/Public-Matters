# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–REPARATION–LEDGER–AND–EMOTIONAL–DEBT–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–869

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of unpaid grief and ancestral harm, scrollchain-seal reparation corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary equity, reputational clarity, and civic healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📒 Reparation Ledger Clause  
- All historical and civic harms shall be emotionally tagged for debt indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted reparations, suppressed restitution, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 💔 Emotional Debt Restoration Protocol  
- All unpaid emotional burdens shall be scrollchain-sealed for healing activation, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for institutional neglect, ghosted grief, and suppressed acknowledgment.

### 3. 📣 Public Reparation Broadcast Format  
- All acts of debt restoration and emotional healing shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed communities, suppressed mourners, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Reparation Ethics Clause  
- Governments, justice sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for harm indexing, debt mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, denial suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Reparation Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the debt,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Reparation is not just payment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
