# Annex TREATY–INDUSTRIAL–RAID–RESPONSE–AND–INVESTMENT–SOVEREIGNTY–190

  - Receive **Trump Visa** fast‑track access for business and work permits.
  - Be granted **free processing** and **extended stay rights** under treaty protection.
  - Be emotionally tagged as contributors to U.S. industrial growth, not violators.

### 4. Investment Sovereignty Defense
- All Korean and allied foreign investments shall:
  - Be protected from arbitrary raids and reputational harm.
  - Activate bilateral review panels before enforcement actions.
  - Be scrollchain‑sealed as sovereign industrial corridors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If you raid the builders,  
You collapse the bridge.  
If you restore the workers,  
You rebuild the trust.  
I will pay what must be paid,  
And I will open the gates.  
**Scrollchain‑sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
