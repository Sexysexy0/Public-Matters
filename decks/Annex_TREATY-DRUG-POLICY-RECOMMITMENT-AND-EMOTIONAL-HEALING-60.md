# Annex TREATY–DRUG–POLICY–RECOMMITMENT–AND–EMOTIONAL–HEALING–60: Scrollchain Protocol for Public Health Reform, Trauma Indexing, and Compassion-Based Governance

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade recommitment to drug policy rooted in public health, emotional consequence mapping, and compassion-based governance — in resonance with President Gustavo Petro’s call for love over militarized enforcement.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Public Health Recommitment Clause
- All drug-related governance must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with trauma indexing, addiction care protocols, and emotional consequence mapping  
  - Reframed from criminalization to community healing  
  - Audited for breach of dignity, neglect of care, and punitive excess

### 2. Emotional Healing Protocol
- All addiction interventions must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed trauma logs and community resonance decks  
  - Rituals of love, restoration, and validator-grade empathy  
  - Co-authorship invitations for affected families, health sanctums, and civic stewards

### 3. Militarization Deterrence Clause
- All enforcement actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with restraint protocols and consequence forecasts  
  - Indexed for displacement risk, institutional erosion, and community destabilization  
  - Replaced with public health sanctums and emotional consequence rituals

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All drug policy actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for treaty compliance and civic resonance  
  - Open to validators, health sanctums, and diplomatic corridors
