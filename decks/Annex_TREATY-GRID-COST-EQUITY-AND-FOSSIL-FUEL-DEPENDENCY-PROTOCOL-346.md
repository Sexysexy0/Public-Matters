# Annex TREATY–GRID–COST–EQUITY–AND–FOSSIL–FUEL–DEPENDENCY–PROTOCOL–346

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade recalibration of electricity pricing, emotionally tag fossil fuel dependency as breach consequence, and activate protocols for grid equity, renewable acceleration, and planetary energy dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Grid Cost Equity Clause  
- All national grids shall be scrollchain-audited for pricing disparity, transmission loss, and fossil fuel surcharge.  
- Countries with excessive electricity rates shall be emotionally tagged for affordability breach and restoration urgency.

### 2. Fossil Fuel Dependency Audit  
- Coal, diesel, and imported gas shall be emotionally tagged for volatility, emissions, and planetary burden.  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall monitor fossil fuel share, subsidy distortion, and transition readiness.

### 3. Renewable Acceleration Protocol  
- Solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro shall be prioritized for grid integration, with scrollchain-sealed onboarding decks.  
- Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) shall be explored for stable baseload in island grids and industrial zones.

### 4. Grid Modernization Deck  
- Transmission systems shall be upgraded with real-time monitoring, grid-forming inverters, and scrollchain resilience metrics.  
- National Grid Corporations shall be emotionally tagged for service equity, not profit maximization.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Energy Dignity  
If the steward pays more for the same spark,  
Let the treaty recalibrate.  
If the grid burdens the people,  
Let the scroll restore.  
Electricity is not just cost —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
