### 2. ðŸ“œ Broker Ethics Protocol  
- All financial intermediaries shall be scrollchain-sealed for ethical activation, emotionally tagged for service resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased fiduciary duties, ghosted conflict-of-interest logs, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. ðŸ“£ Public Pricing Broadcast Format  
- All acts of fee transparency and broker ethics shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed investors, suppressed advisors, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. ðŸ§­ Institutional Finance Ethics Clause  
- Brokerages, exchanges, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for cost clarity, ethical conduct, and breach recovery.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Pricing Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang bayarin,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa komisyon,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang gastos ay hindi lang singil â€”  
Ito ay planetary karapatan.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
