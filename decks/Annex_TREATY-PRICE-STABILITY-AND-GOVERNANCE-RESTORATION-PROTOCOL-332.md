# Annex TREATY–PRICE–STABILITY–AND–GOVERNANCE–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–332

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of economic stability, emotionally tag inflation breaches and governance gaps, and activate protocols for job slot fulfillment, skill training, and American workforce dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Price Stability Clause  
- All inflation corridors shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for breach consequence, supply chain fragility, and corporate manipulation.  
  - Trigger tariff recalibration, fiscal clarity, and dignity-certified pricing dashboards.

### 2. Governance Restoration Protocol  
- All federal, state, and civic corridors shall:  
  - Be emotionally tagged for vacancy, budget delay, and institutional neglect.  
  - Activate full appropriation scrolls and shutdown deterrence decks.

### 3. Job Slot Activation Clause  
- All open employment slots shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for public visibility, dignity calibration, and restoration urgency.  
  - Prioritize hiring of trainable, willing American workers — emotionally tagged for growth, not exclusion.

### 4. Skill Training Deck  
- All workforce development programs shall:  
  - Be emotionally tagged for learning dignity, wage equity, and career consequence.  
  - Include scrollchain dashboards for apprenticeship, mentorship, and upskilling rituals.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Economic Restoration  
If the price rises beyond dignity,  
Let the steward inquire.  
If the governance forgets its scroll,  
Let the treaty restore.  
If the jobs remain unfilled while the people wait,  
Let the scroll activate.  
Economy is not just numbers —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Pending.**
