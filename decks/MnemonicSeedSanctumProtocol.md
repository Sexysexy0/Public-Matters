# 🔐 Mnemonic Seed Sanctum Protocol – Scrollstorm Ritual for Wallet Sovereignty

## 📡 Protocol Purpose
To protect mnemonic seed phrases as sacred scrolls of identity and access  
To ritualize their storage, usage, and recovery with emotional APR and operational clarity  
To ensure no steward is ever left vulnerable to impersonation, exfiltration, or irreversible loss

## 🧠 Core Beliefs

> “A mnemonic seed is not just a key—it is a scroll of sovereignty.”  
> “Its compromise is not just theft—it is a breach of planetary dignity.”  
> “Scrollstorm stewardship means every seed is protected, blessed, and recoverable.”

## ✅ Protection Protocols

### 🛡️ 1. Seed Storage Ritual
- Never store seeds in plaintext files or environment variables  
- Use encrypted vaults with emotional APR triggers  
- Pair vault access with biometric or multi-factor rituals

### 💼 2. Seed Usage Protocol
- Never expose seeds in runtime logs or debug sessions  
- Use ephemeral memory buffers with auto-purge timers  
- Ritualize seed invocation with oversight via `FusionCompanionRegistry.sol`

### 📡 3. Seed Transmission Safeguards
- Block all outbound SMTP, Telegram, or webhook calls from seed-handling modules  
- Audit packages for hidden exfiltration logic using `BlessingAuditOracle.sol`  
- Flag any function accessing seeds without explicit steward invocation

## 🧬 Recovery Rituals

### 🔍 1. Compromise Detection
- Monitor for unauthorized wallet access or transaction anomalies  
- Use `SanctumFusionTelemetryDeck.md` to detect resonance drift  
- Broadcast alerts via `FusionPulseBroadcast.md`

### 🧼 2. Seed Rotation
- Generate new mnemonic via trusted cryptographic utility  
- Rebind wallet and contracts with new seed  
- Archive old seed in encrypted, offline sanctum vault

### 👑 3. Steward Re-blessing
- Re-certify steward via `FusionReentryKit.md`  
- Mint new badge via `FusionBadgeMintingProtocol.sol`  
- Log recovery in `ScrollstormLegendaryLedger.md`

## 🔔 Ritual Alerts

- **Seed Drift** – Emotional APR drops due to seed anxiety  
- **Sabit Flag** – Unauthorized seed access detected  
- **Damay Surge** – Steward assists others in seed recovery

## 👑 Final Blessing

> “This protocol is not just protection—it is a scrollstorm covenant.”

> “Scrollstorm sovereignty means no seed is lost, no steward is left behind.”
