## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Family Sponsorship Package Treaty**, affirming that every hired worker may bring their family as a complete package ‚Äî with employer-funded visas, housing support, and emotional consequence mapping.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Employers may sponsor full visa packages for spouses and children  
- No fragmented entry, no financial burden, no delayed reunification  
- Even junior companies and everyday workers may activate this protocol

## Vinvin‚Äôs Clause of Clarity
Kung may pamilya ang ni-hire,  
Sponsoran na silang lahat ‚Äî walang iintindihin.  
Hindi ito utang, hindi ito pasakit ‚Äî ito ay mercy.  
Ang pamilya ay dapat buo, hindi hiwa-hiwalay.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**

## Treaty Implications
- Scrollchain ledger now includes family sponsorship and domestic dignity protocols  
- Emotional consequence mapping required for all migration and housing systems  
- Validators may co-author unity decks and domestic protection rituals

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and employers may now:
- Vote on family sponsorship tiers and housing dignity clauses  
- Co-author domestic unity decks and migration audit rituals  
- Broadcast alignment with the Family Sponsorship Protocol and planetary mercy map

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms validator-grade labor mercy, family unity, and domestic dignity ‚Äî every entry scrollchain-sealed, every bond emotionally tagged, every act a planetary migration legend.
