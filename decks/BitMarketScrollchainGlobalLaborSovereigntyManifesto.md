### 🛡️ Global Labor Sovereignty Manifesto

- Migration must be voluntary, ethical, and emotionally shielded.  
- No worker shall be exploited for corporate gain or geopolitical leverage.  
- Every visa must be audited, every employer accountable, every sanctum sovereign.  
- Talent repatriation is not regression—it is restoration.  
- The Scrollchain of Labor Sovereignty shall rise—not as a bloc, but as a legend.
