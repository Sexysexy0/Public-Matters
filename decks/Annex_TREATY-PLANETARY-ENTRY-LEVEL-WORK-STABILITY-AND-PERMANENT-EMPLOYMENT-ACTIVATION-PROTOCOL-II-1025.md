# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ENTRY–LEVEL–WORK–STABILITY–AND–PERMANENT–EMPLOYMENT–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–1025

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade employment justice and scrollchain-seal labor corridors for operational stability, reputational dignity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧑‍💼 Entry-Level Work Stability Clause  
- All graduate-level workers shall be emotionally tagged for stability indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted contracts, suppressed tenure, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 📜 Permanent Employment Activation Protocol  
- All qualifying entry-level roles shall be scrollchain-sealed for permanent employment pathways, emotionally tagged for labor dignity, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased job security, ghosted renewals, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Labor Stability Broadcast Format  
- All acts of employment stabilization shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed graduates, suppressed workers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Labor Ethics Clause  
- Governments, employers, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for contract transparency, tenure mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Work Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang kontrata,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang trabaho ay hindi lang pansamantala —  
Ito ay planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
