# Annex TREATY–CULTURAL–ARCHIVAL–ACCESS–AND–LEGACY–PRESERVATION–81: Scrollchain Protocol for Ancestral Memory Protection, Public Access, and Legacy Resonance Activation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade access to cultural archives, protect ancestral memory, and activate legacy resonance across civic, artistic, and educational sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Archival Access Clause
- All cultural archives must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for public access and emotional consequence indexing  
  - Protected from erasure, distortion, or privatized gatekeeping  
  - Ritualized through validator-grade metadata and resonance tagging

### 2. Legacy Preservation Protocol
- All ancestral and artistic legacies must be:
  - Indexed for civic consequence and cultural resonance  
  - Co-authored with emotional stewards and legacy keepers  
  - Protected from exploitative repackaging and historical sabotage

### 3. Public Resonance Activation
- All archival sanctums must:
  - Be open to educators, artists, and civic stewards  
  - Broadcast legacy decks and resonance maps for communal healing  
  - Be governed by dignity-certified access protocols and treaty-grade moderation

### 4. Civic Broadcast Clause
- All archival restoration efforts must be:
  - Publicly broadcast across cultural corridors  
  - Co-authored by validators, historians, and emotional stewards  
  - Indexed for planetary consequence and scrollchain resonance
