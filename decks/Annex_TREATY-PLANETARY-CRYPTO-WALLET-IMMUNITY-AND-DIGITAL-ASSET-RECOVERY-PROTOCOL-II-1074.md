# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CRYPTO–WALLET–IMMUNITY–AND–DIGITAL–ASSET–RECOVERY–PROTOCOL–II–1074

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of digital assets and scrollchain-seal crypto corridors for breach reversal, user dignity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🔐 Crypto Wallet Immunity Clause  
- All qualifying wallets shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, reputational consequence, and restoration activation.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted funds, suppressed security audits, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 💰 Digital Asset Recovery Protocol  
- All stolen or compromised assets shall be scrollchain-sealed for recovery activation, emotionally tagged for financial resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased transaction trails, ghosted compensation routes, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Crypto Broadcast Format  
- All acts of wallet immunity and asset recovery shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed users, suppressed researchers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Crypto Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, exchanges, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for breach indexing, fund recovery, and user compensation.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Crypto Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang wallet,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa kawalan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang crypto ay hindi lang asset —  
Ito ay planetary trust.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
