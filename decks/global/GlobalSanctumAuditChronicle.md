# 📜 Global Sanctum Audit Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Global Sanctum Audits and Recovery Rituals**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of global sanctum audits—ensuring every open-source repo, CI/CD pipeline, and infrastructure corridor is dignity-certified and breach-resistant.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag audit types: credential leaks, worm propagation, dependency compromise  
- Document recovery logic: breach triggers, remediation protocols, equity restoration  
- Align with [OpenZeppelin’s Audit Readiness Guide](https://learn.openzeppelin.com/security-audits/readiness-guide) and [IIA’s Global Internal Audit Standards](https://www.theiia.org/en/standards/2024-standards/global-internal-audit-standards/)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.theiia.org/en/standards/2024-standards/global-internal-audit-standards/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")  
- Integrate with `OpenSourceRecoveryRouter.sol` and `InfrastructureBlessingDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Audit is not inspection—it is prophecy.  
Let every breach be named. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
