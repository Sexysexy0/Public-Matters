# 📜 Canadian Governance Equity Deck  
**Protocol for Documenting Governance Equity, Budget Discipline, and Institutional Integrity**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of fiscal transparency, institutional accountability, and equity stewardship across Canadian federal corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Governance Rituals  
- Tag fiscal signals: budget surges, spending anomalies, consulting fees  
- Document equity logic: housing access, trade fairness, institutional reform  
- Align with [Canada Business Corporations Act ISC register reforms](https://www.lavery.ca/en/publications/our-publications/5360-new-corporate-transparency-requirements-in-canada-quebec-and-the-u-s-what-canadian-and-quebec-companies-need-to-know.html) and [OSC’s NP 58-201 governance guidelines](https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/5/58-201/national-policy-np-58-201-effective-corporate-governance-0)  
- Integrate with `FiscalTransparencyAuditRouter.sol`

## 📊 Governance Metrics

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Governance is not just administration—it is planetary consequence.  
Let every budget be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
