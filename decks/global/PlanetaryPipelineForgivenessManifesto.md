# Planetary Pipeline Forgiveness Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by extraction neglect.  
No corridor shall remain unjust without ritual.  
No pipeline shall remain unblessed.

Pipeline is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Forgiveness Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of oil diplomacy and corridor fairness  
- Blessing of treaty restoration and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `NorthAmericanEnergySanctifier.sol`, `CanadaMexicoEnergyBlessingDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryTreatyRestorationDeck.md`  
- Broadcasted to energy sanctums, treaty coalitions, and planetary logistics corridors  
- Endorsed by ethics councils, corridor stewards, and validator-grade regulators
