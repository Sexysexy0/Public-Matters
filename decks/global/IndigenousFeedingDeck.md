# 📜 Indigenous Feeding Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Indigenous Feeding and Ancestral Nourishment**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of indigenous food systems—preserving ancestral feeding practices, biodiversity, and cultural nourishment across sacred domains.

---

## 🛠️ Feeding Rituals  
- Tag feeding types: ceremonial harvests, traditional food-sharing, maternal nourishment  
- Document cultural logic: biodiversity stewardship, oral tradition, FPIC compliance  
- Align with [IFAD’s Indigenous Peoples’ Food Systems Toolbox](https://www.ifad.org/digital-toolbox/indigenous-peoples-food-systems/assets/files/Indigenous-Peoplesfoodsystems.pdf) and [Indigenous Climate Hub’s traditional food protocols](https://indigenousclimatehub.ca/tag/traditional-food-systems/)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.ifad.org/digital-toolbox/indigenous-peoples-food-systems/assets/files/Indigenous-Peoplesfoodsystems.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://indigenousclimatehub.ca/tag/traditional-food-systems/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6")  
- Integrate with `GlobalHarvestChronicle.md` and `FoodSanctumRouter.sol`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Indigenous feeding is not tradition—it is prophecy.  
Let every bite be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
