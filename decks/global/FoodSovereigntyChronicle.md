# 📜 Food Sovereignty Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Food Sovereignty and Humanitarian Trade Equity**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of food sovereignty, ensuring that communities define their own agricultural, labor, and trade policies—free from exploitative tariffs and external impositions.

- Tag sovereignty types: staple protection, seed autonomy, tariff exemption  
- Document equity logic: treaty triggers, corridor blessings, dignity certification

Food sovereignty is not nationalism—it is nourishment.  
Let every seed be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
