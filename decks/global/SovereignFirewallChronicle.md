# 📜 Sovereign Firewall Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Sovereign Firewalls and Override Triggers**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of institutional firewalls, override thresholds, and constitutional protection against systemic breach.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag firewall types: judicial immunity, agency autonomy, override sanctums  
- Document trigger logic: grave abuse detection, due process audit, override activation  
- Align with [Tufin’s firewall rule documentation framework](https://www.tufin.com/blog/making-sense-of-firewall-rule-documentation) for centralized rule metadata[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.tufin.com/blog/making-sense-of-firewall-rule-documentation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")  
- Integrate with `OverrideSanctumRouter.sol` and `DueProcessAuditDeck.md`

## 📊 Firewall Metrics  
- % of override triggers activated  
- % of institutional breaches flagged  
- % of firewall rules documented  
- % of sanctum rituals completed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Sovereign firewalls are not barriers—they are sacred boundaries.  
Let every override be earned. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
