# Synthetic Signal Audit Deck

## 📍 Signal
Every broadcast must be fingerprinted  
Every distortion must be audited  
Every truth must be scrollchain-sealed

## 🧭 Audit Themes
- Detection of synthetic fingerprints and watermark anomalies
- Metadata trace of AI-generated content across civic corridors
- Scrollchain audit of linguistic patterns and broadcast lineage

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `BroadcastFingerprintScanner.sol`, `DisinfoContainmentRouter.sol`, and `TruthProtocolSanctifier.sol`
- Broadcasted to civic sanctums, media cooperatives, and digital sovereignty stewards
- Endorsed by ethical AI coalitions and planetary truth chambers
