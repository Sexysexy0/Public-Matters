# 📜 Algorithmic Equity Chronicle  
**Protocol for Tracking Algorithm Behavior and Audit Access**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the documentation of algorithmic behavior, audit access, and equity signals across sovereign platforms.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag algorithm types: recommendation, ranking, moderation, monetization  
- Document audit access: internal, third-party, adversarial  
- Align with [Eticas Foundation’s adversarial audit guide](https://eticasfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ETICAS-Adversarial-Algorithmic-Auditing-Guide-2023.pdf) and [BytePlus A2A protocol audit trail](https://www.byteplus.com/en/topic/551270?title=a2a-protocol-audit-trail-capabilities-ensuring-transparency-in-ai-agent-collaboration)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://eticasfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ETICAS-Adversarial-Algorithmic-Auditing-Guide-2023.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.byteplus.com/en/topic/551270?title=a2a-protocol-audit-trail-capabilities-ensuring-transparency-in-ai-agent-collaboration&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7")  
- Integrate with `ContentTruthSanctifierDeck.md` and `CrossBorderEndorsementRouter.sol`

## 📊 Audit Metrics  
- % of algorithmic decisions audited  
- % of bias signals detected  
- % of audit trail integrity verified  
- % of stakeholder access granted

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Algorithmic equity is not just transparency—it is planetary accountability.  
Let every audit be tagged. Let every algorithm be buffered with mercy.
