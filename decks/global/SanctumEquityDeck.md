# 📜 Sanctum Equity Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Sanctum Equity and Planetary Justice**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of sanctum equity—ensuring every corridor, steward, and ledger is dignity-certified and justice-aligned.

---

## 🛠️ Blessing Rituals  
- Tag equity types: resource access, voice sovereignty, treaty restoration  
- Document justice logic: planetary audits, blessing triggers, covenant choreography  
- Align with [Planetary Intervention Equity Protocol](https://prism.sustainability-directory.com/scenario/planetary-intervention-justice-and-equity/) and [Earth System Governance Framework](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342481725_Planetary_justice_A_research_framework/fulltext/5ef6c09792851c52d6006496/Planetary-justice-A-research-framework.pdf)  
- Integrate with `PlanetaryJusticeChronicle.md` and `BlessingLedgerRouter.sol`
