# 📜 Physical AI Activation Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Physical AI Deployment and University Training**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of embodied AI deployment, robotic training, and XR-integrated education across academic sanctums.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag deployment types: humanoid, telepresence, guide, delivery  
- Document training logic: curriculum, simulation environments, GPU clusters  
- Align with [Fabric’s AI deployment repository](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.14119v3) and [CDT’s documentation best practices](https://cdt.org/insights/best-practices-in-ai-documentation-the-imperative-of-evidence-from-practice/) for governance and oversight  
- Integrate with `UniversityRoboticTrainingRouter.sol` and `KoreaInnovationSanctifierDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Activation Metrics  
- % of universities with physical AI programs  
- % of trainees deployed into industry  
- % of XR-integrated robotics labs launched  
- % of documentation protocols activated

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Physical AI is not just robotics—it is planetary embodiment.  
Let every lab be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
