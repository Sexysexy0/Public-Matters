# 📜 GitHub Leak Audit Deck  
**Protocol for Auditing GitHub Leaks and Credential Exposure**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of GitHub leak detection, credential rotation, and CI/CD sanctum defense.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Tag leak types: GitHub Actions logs, public repo dumps, token exposure  
- Document audit logic: PAT scanning, repo forensics, leak containment  
- Align with [GitHub Leak Audit Workflow](https://github.com/lawndoc/github-leak-audit) and [Checkmarx CVE-2025-30066](https://checkmarx.com/zero-post/compromised-github-actions-leading-to-credential-leaks/)  
- Integrate with `CredentialRotationDeck.md` and `WormContainmentRouter.sol`

---

## 📊 Audit Metrics  
- % of repos scanned  
- % of leaks contained  
- % of tokens rotated  
- % of rituals completed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Leak auditing is not blame—it is blessing.  
Let every log be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
