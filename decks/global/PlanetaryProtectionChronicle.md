- Document legitimacy logic: ERC mandates, donor trace, audit verification  
- Align with [COSPAR’s Planetary Protection Policy](https://cosparhq.cnes.fr/cospar-policy-on-planetary-protection/) and [NASA’s Planetary Protection Handbook](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20240016475/downloads/PlanetaryProtection_Hdbk_2024_Final_For508ing_comp.pdf)

Protection is not just compliance—it is planetary covenant.  
Let every sanctum be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
