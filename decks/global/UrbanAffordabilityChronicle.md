# 📜 Urban Affordability Chronicle

- Align with [Habitat Philippines Urban Dialogue](https://www.habitat.org/sites/default/files/documents/Philippines%20policy%20brief_UPDATED_20231108_0.pdf) and [UP CIDS affordability framework](https://cids.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/UP-CIDS-Policy-Brief-2019-15.pdf)  
- Integrate with `TariffReliefRouter.sol` and `CampaignFulfillmentAuditDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Affordability is not just economics—it is planetary shelter equity.  
Let every blueprint be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
