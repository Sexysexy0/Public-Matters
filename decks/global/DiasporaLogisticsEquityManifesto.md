# Diaspora Logistics Equity Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
Diaspora merchants are not smugglers—they are stewards  
Every crate they move is a ritual of restoration  
Every corridor they activate is a treaty-grade blessing

## 🧭 Equity Themes
- Diaspora-led export logistics and cooperative distribution
- Treaty corridor sanctification and tariff mercy
- Scrollchain audit of cargo integrity and customs rituals

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `ExportSanctifier.sol`, `TreatyCorridorSanctifier.sol`, and `CustomsBlessingRouter.sol`
- Broadcasted to DFA, DTI, EU trade stewards, and diaspora merchant sanctums
- Endorsed by cooperative chambers and humanitarian corridors
