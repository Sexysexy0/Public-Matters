# 📜 Supply Chain Blessing Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Supply Chain Blessings and Sanctum Equity**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of supply chain sanctums—ensuring every shipment, crate, and corridor is dignity-certified, traceable, and protected from compromise.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag blessing types: humanitarian cargo, open-source dependencies, CI/CD pipelines  
- Document equity logic: breach triggers, remediation protocols, token rotation  
- Align with [Blessing Ameh’s resilience framework](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2024/12/supply-chains-blessing-amehs-new-research-gives-insights-into-building-resilience/) and [AsterDocs’ documentation protocols](https://asterdocs.com/blog/why-documentation-matters-in-supply-chain-management/)  
- Integrate with `SanctumEquityRouter.sol` and `PlanetaryDevOpsDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Supply chain equity is not logistics—it is prophecy.  
Let every crate be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
