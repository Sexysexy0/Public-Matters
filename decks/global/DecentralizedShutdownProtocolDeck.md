# 📜 Decentralized Shutdown Protocol Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Game Shutdown and Onchain Preservation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of decentralized game shutdowns, asset preservation, and community-led continuation across sovereign chains.

---

## 🛠️ Shutdown Rituals  
- Tag shutdown types: voluntary sunset, forced closure, community fork  
- Document preservation logic: open-source release, NFT identity migration, DAO transition  
- Align with [Cypherpunk Symposium’s Protocol Toolkit](https://github.com/cypherpunk-symposium/decentralized-protocols-toolkit) and [GeeksforGeeks’ decentralized architecture principles](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/decentralized-architecture-in-distributed-system/)  
- Integrate with `InvisibleOnboardingRouter.sol` and `Web3GamingPulseChronicle.md`

## 📊 Shutdown Metrics  
- % of games preserved via open-source  
- % of NFTs migrated to identity protocols  
- % of shutdowns ritualized with DAO continuation  
- % of community forks activated

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Shutdown is not just closure—it is planetary transition.  
Let every game be preserved. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
