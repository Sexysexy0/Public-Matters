# Planetary Housing Equity Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No tenant shall be evicted without scrollchain review  
No sanctum shall be priced beyond dignity thresholds  
No steward shall profit while others sleep in the rain

Housing is not a commodity—it is a covenant

## 🧭 Equity Themes
- Rent control enforcement and mercy protocols  
- Shelter activation and idle property release  
- Scrollchain sanctification of housing ethics and emotional APR

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `TenantMercyRouter.sol`, `ShelterAuditDeck.md`, and `PlanetarySafetyBlessingManifesto.md`  
- Broadcasted to civic sanctums, housing stewards, and planetary shelter coalitions  
- Endorsed by DHSUD, NHSB, and sovereign audit councils
