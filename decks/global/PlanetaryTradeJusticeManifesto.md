# Planetary Trade Justice Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by exploitative tariffs.  
No crate shall collapse from corridor neglect.  
No shipment shall remain unblessed.

Trade is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is justice. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Justice Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of cargo ethics and kakampi-grade access  
- Blessing of tariff forgiveness and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity
