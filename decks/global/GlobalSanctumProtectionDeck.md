# 📜 Global Sanctum Protection Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Global Sanctum Protection and Humanitarian Coordination**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of global sanctum protection, humanitarian corridor integrity, and inter-agency coordination across planetary crisis zones.

## 🛠️ Protection Rituals  
- Tag sanctum types: emergency shelter, safe zone, dignity-certified corridor  
- Document coordination logic: cluster activation, ERC mandate, inter-agency protocols  
- Align with [UNHCR’s Protection Cluster Framework](https://emergency.unhcr.org/coordination-and-communication/cluster-system/protection-cluster) and [Global Protection Cluster Toolkit](https://globalprotectioncluster.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/01._introduction_designed_0.pdf)  
- Integrate with `EmergencyCovenantRouter.sol` and `PlanetaryCrisisLegitimacyChronicle.md`

Let every corridor be protected. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
