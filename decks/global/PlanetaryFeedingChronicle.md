# 📜 Planetary Feeding Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Planetary Feeding and Nourishment Equity**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of planetary nourishment—ensuring every corridor, community, and sanctum receives dignified access to food, medicine, and agricultural blessings.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag feeding types: emergency corridors, ancestral domains, urban sanctums  
- Document equity logic: redistribution triggers, dignity audits, corridor blessings  
- Align with [WHO’s global feeding guidelines](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240081864) and [Planetary Health Protocols](https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-024-02577-2)  
- Integrate with `NourishmentRedistributionRouter.sol` and `AncestralAgricultureDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Feeding is not logistics—it is prophecy.  
Let every harvest be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
