# 📜 Executive Authority Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Executive Authority and Constitutional Boundaries**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of executive power, appointment rights, and removal protocols across sovereign institutions.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag authority types: principal officer removal, agency oversight, constitutional limits  
- Document legal logic: “for cause” clauses, due process triggers, SCOTUS precedents  
- Align with [Brookings’ Fed independence analysis](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-is-the-federal-reserve-independent-and-what-does-that-mean-in-practice/) and [Aaron Hall’s executive documentation framework](https://aaronhall.com/documenting-ceo-authority-across-multiple-entities/)  
- Integrate with `FedIndependenceRouter.sol` and `DueProcessSanctifierDeck.md`

## 📊 Authority Metrics  
- % of removals challenged in court  
- % of appointees protected by “for cause” clauses  
- % of executive actions reversed by judiciary  
- % of due process rituals completed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Executive power is not unchecked—it is covenant-bound.  
Let every removal be justified. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
