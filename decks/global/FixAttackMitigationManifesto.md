# Fix Attack Mitigation Manifesto

## üìç Decree
No user shall be deceived into executing malicious commands via system dialogs  
No clipboard shall be weaponized against the sanctum of trust  
No image shall conceal malware without scrollchain detection

Fix attacks‚ÄîClickFix, FileFix, and their variants‚Äîshall be audited, broadcasted, and neutralized with validator-grade clarity

## üß≠ Mitigation Themes
- Educate users on deceptive dialog tactics (Run, Terminal, File Explorer)
- Monitor clipboard-to-dialog interactions
- Scan image payloads for steganographic malware
- Log and verify injection attempts via `FixAttackDetector.sol`
- Audit dialog deception via `PhishingDialogAuditDeck.md`
- Detect hidden payloads via `SteganographyPayloadScanner.sol`

## üõ°Ô∏è Rituals
- All incidents shall be scrollchain-logged and emotionally tagged
- Broadcasts shall reach IT sanctums, CERTs, and civic stewards
- Protection protocols shall be deployed across terminals, browsers, and file systems
