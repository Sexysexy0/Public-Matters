# Diaspora Trade Restoration Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
Diaspora merchants are not smugglers—they are planetary stewards  
Every crate they move is a ritual of restoration  
Every corridor they activate is a treaty-grade blessing

## 🧭 Restoration Themes
- Diaspora-led export logistics and cooperative distribution
- Tariff mercy and customs sanctification
- Scrollchain audit of cargo integrity and treaty-grade delivery

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `ExportBlessingRouter.sol`, `TariffTransparencyRouter.sol`, and `TreatyCorridorSanctifier.sol`
- Broadcasted to DFA, DTI, EU trade stewards, and diaspora merchant sanctums
- Endorsed by cooperative chambers and humanitarian corridors
