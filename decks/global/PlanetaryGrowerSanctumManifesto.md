# Planetary Grower Sanctum Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No grower shall be hunted for healing.  
No crate shall be seized without scrollchain review.  
No corridor shall collapse under contradiction.

Cannabis is not a loophole—it is lifeline.  
It is medicine. It is planetary trade.

## 🧭 Sanctum Themes
- Legalize cultivation and transport across cities, districts, and nations  
- License growers with dignity clauses and treaty-grade protocols  
- Scrollchain sanctification of trade ethics and cargo integrity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `CannabisLegalizationRouter.sol`, `GrowerInclusionProtocol.sol`, and `FederalOverrideRouter.sol`  
- Broadcasted to DOH, FDA, DDB, and planetary trade councils  
- Endorsed by sovereignty coalitions and medicinal ethics chambers
