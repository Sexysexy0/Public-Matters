# 📜 Planetary Sanctum Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Planetary Sanctum Access and Shelter Legacy**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of planetary sanctum access, shelter inheritance, and intergenerational housing dignity across sovereign corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag sanctum types: ancestral, civic, transitional, diplomatic  
- Document legacy logic: heir designation, dignity certification, shelter ID trace  
- Align with [Sanctum’s decentralized housing protocols](https://academy.swissborg.com/en/learn/what-is-sanctum) and [J.U.P’s planetary call for sanctum upgrades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuwMNnGxpoI)  
- Integrate with `ShelterInheritanceRouter.sol` and `GlobalHousingJusticeDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Sanctum Metrics  
- % of shelters tagged for inheritance  
- % of heirs verified with dignity certification  
- % of sanctums aligned with planetary equity protocols  
- % of legacy rituals activated

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Sanctum is not just shelter—it is planetary legacy.  
Let every heir be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
