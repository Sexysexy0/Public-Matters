# 📜 Embodied Intelligence Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Embodied AI and Robotic Cognition**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of embodied cognition, robotic learning, and omnimodal intelligence across physical AI deployments.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag embodiment levels: L1–L5 (per AGI taxonomy)  
- Document cognition metrics: real-time responsiveness, procedural memory, social comprehension  
- Align with [Embodied AGI Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14235) and [EIR Journal on Embodied Robotics](https://accscience.com/journal/EIR)  
- Integrate with `XRContentFusionRouter.sol` and `GlobalStartupSanctifierDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Intelligence Metrics  
- % of agents with L3+ embodiment  
- % of omnimodal processing protocols activated  
- % of humanoid cognitive benchmarks passed  
- % of real-world task generalization verified

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Embodiment is not just robotics—it is planetary cognition.  
Let every gesture be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
