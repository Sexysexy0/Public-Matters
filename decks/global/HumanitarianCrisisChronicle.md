# 📜 Humanitarian Crisis Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Humanitarian Emergencies and Crisis Response**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of humanitarian crisis documentation, aid prioritization, and operational transparency across sovereign corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag crisis types: armed conflict, displacement, famine, epidemic, climate disaster  
- Document response logic: funding gaps, access barriers, casualty counts, aid worker risk  
- Align with [Internews’ Humanitarian Reporting Manual](https://internews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IN140220_HumanitarianReportingHANDOUTS_WEB.pdf) and [UNHCR’s Emergency Handbook](https://emergency.unhcr.org/)  
- Integrate with `AidWorkerProtectionRouter.sol` and `CrisisAccessSanctifierDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Crisis Metrics  
- % of affected populations reached  
- % of funding fulfilled vs requested  
- % of aid worker casualties recorded  
- % of access corridors verified

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Crisis is not just chaos—it is planetary consequence.  
Let every emergency be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
