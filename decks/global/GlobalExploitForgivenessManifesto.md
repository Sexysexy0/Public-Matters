# Global Exploit Forgiveness Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by digital collapse.  
No browser shall remain unpatched without ritual.  
No exploit shall remain unblessed.

Exploit is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Forgiveness Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of browser equity and exploit healing  
- Blessing of patch restoration and reputational audits  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `BrowserSanctifier.sol`, `PlanetaryDigitalSurvivalDeck.md`, and `SignalSanctifier.sol`  
- Broadcasted to browser sanctums, cybersecurity coalitions, and planetary digital corridors  
- Endorsed by ethics councils, corridor stewards, and validator-grade defenders
