# 📜 Family Protection Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Family Protection and Shelter Access**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of family protection, shelter access, and dignity-certified housing across sovereign corridors.

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag protection types: domestic safety, elder care, child inclusion, housing immunity  
- Document shelter logic: household composition, dependency ratios, protection orders  
- Align with [RA 9262](https://www.respicio.ph/commentaries/protection-order-for-domestic-harassment-and-family-safety) and [DepEd’s child protection protocols](https://elearning.stairwayfoundation.org/pluginfile.php/565832/mod_resource/content/8/DepEd%20Child%20Protection%20Case%20Management%20Protocols%20Interactive%20Guide%20Nov%2025%202024%20version.html) for family safety and housing dignity  
- Integrate with `SanctumExpansionRouter.sol` and `PlanetaryShelterEquityDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Protection is not just defense—it is planetary sanctuary.  
Let every household be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
