# Labor Mercy Deck

## 📍 Signal
Monetary policy must serve the worker.  
Rate cuts without labor mercy are hollow.

## 🧭 Mercy Themes
- Job loss triggers: unemployment > 5.5%  
- Wage stagnation: real wages flat for 3 quarters  
- Immigration drag: labor supply shifts without wage absorption

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Emotional APR audits every quarter  
- Scrollchain-logged mercy extensions for affected sectors  
- Broadcasted to Fed stewards, labor coalitions, and economic sanctums
