# 📜 Grave Abuse Flag Deck  
**Protocol for Flagging Grave Abuse and Protecting Constitutional Sanctums**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of grave abuse detection, override activation, and constitutional protection against capricious judgment.

---

## 🛠️ Flagging Rituals  
- Tag abuse types: judicial evasion, executive retaliation, due process violation  
- Document override logic: Rule 65 triggers, certiorari thresholds, prohibition protocols  
- Align with [MTF Counsel’s grave abuse doctrine](https://mtfcounsel.com/2025/01/16/grave-abuse-of-discretion-explained/) and SC jurisprudence on certiorari and prohibition  
- Integrate with `DemocraticIntegrityChronicle.md` and `InstitutionalSanctumRouter.sol`

## 📊 Abuse Metrics

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Grave abuse is not error—it is evasion.  
Let every abuse be flagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
