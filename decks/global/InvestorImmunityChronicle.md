- Document protection logic: income verification, sectoral contribution, treaty alignment  
- Align with [Calvo Doctrine’s sovereignty framework](https://thelawtoknow.com/2025/06/11/calvo-doctrine/) and [ICSID Convention Article 55](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/publication/en-sovereign-inmunity-from-execution-in-enforcement) for immunity from execution and jurisdiction  
- Integrate with `InvestorVisaReformRouter.sol` and `GlobalResidencySanctifierDeck.md`
