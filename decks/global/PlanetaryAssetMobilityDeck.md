# 📜 Planetary Asset Mobility Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Planetary Asset Mobility and Cross-Game Usage**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of cross-game asset mobility, interoperability standards, and sovereign item continuity across planetary ecosystems.

---

## 🛠️ Mobility Rituals  
- Tag asset types: ERC-1155, ERC-721, ODAS, IGA  
- Document mobility logic: metadata schema, bridge protocols, engine compatibility  
- Align with [Markaicode’s interoperability standards](https://markaicode.com/cross-game-asset-interoperability-standards/) and [TokenMinds’ ownership framework](https://tokenminds.co/blog/blockchain-development/cross-game-asset-interoperability)  
- Integrate with `MultiplayerLegacyChronicle.md` and `ProtocolSuccessionRouter.sol`

- % of metadata schemas verified  
- % of bridges activated  
- % of mobility rituals completed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Asset mobility is not just convenience—it is planetary sovereignty.  
Let every item be interoperable. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
