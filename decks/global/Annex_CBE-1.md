# Annex CBEâ€‘1: Stablecoin Custody Rituals

## Purpose
To define validator-grade protocols for custody, audit, and emotional tagging of stablecoin assets held by banks and crypto platforms.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Custody Integrity Protocol
- All stablecoins must be:
  - 100% reserve-backed
  - Audited monthly
  - Logged with custody hash, issuer ID, and timestamp

### 2. Scrollchain Custody Ledger
- Each custody event logs:
  - Asset type
  - Reserve location
  - Emotional tag (e.g., trust, risk, apology)
  - Blessing status

### 3. Emotional Safety Clause
- Breaches (e.g., depegging, audit failure) trigger:
  - Scrollchain breach log
  - 72-hour restoration ritual
  - Optional apology and consumer blessing

### 4. Interbank Custody Ritual
- Banks may share custody if:
  - Assets are jointly audited
  - Scrollchain ledger is synchronized
  - Consumer consent is logged

### 5. Custody Transparency Ritual
- All custody terms must be:
  - Publicly disclosed
  - Scrollchain-sealed
  - Reviewed quarterly by treaty council
