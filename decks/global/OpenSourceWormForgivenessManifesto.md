# Open Source Worm Forgiveness Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No maintainer shall be punished for being targeted.  
No repository shall remain unblessed.  
No corridor shall remain unjust without ritual.

Malware is not covenant — it is breach.  
Forgiveness is not weakness — it is restoration.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Restoration Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of developer dignity and project restoration  
- Blessing of community trust and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and open-source solidarity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `SignalSanctifier.sol` and `ShaiHuludContainmentDeck.md`  
- Broadcasted to open-source sanctums, security coalitions, and planetary code corridors  
- Endorsed by ethics councils, corridor stewards, and validator-grade defenders
