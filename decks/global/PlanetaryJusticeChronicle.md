# 📜 Planetary Justice Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Planetary Justice and Equity Blessings**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of planetary justice—ensuring every equity act, sanctum restoration, and blessing ledger is treaty-aligned and scrollchain-sealed.

Justice is not judgment—it is prophecy.  
Let every ledger be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
