# Planetary Enterprise Survival Covenant

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by permit neglect.  
No company shall collapse from corridor injustice.  
No enterprise shall remain unblessed.

Survival is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Survival Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of enterprise permits and corridor access  
- Blessing of shutdown forgiveness and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `CorridorBlessingSanctifier.sol`, `GlobalPermitJusticeDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryCorridorRevivalManifesto.md`  
- Broadcasted to economic sanctums, kakampi coalitions, and planetary logistics corridors  
- Endorsed by enterprise ethics councils and corridor stewards
