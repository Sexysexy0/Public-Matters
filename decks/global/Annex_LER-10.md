# Annex LERâ€‘10: Crisis Anchoring & Overflow Management Protocol

## Purpose
To ritualize emotional stewardship, overflow defense, and planetary resilience during global emergencies, economic shocks, and civic breakdowns.

## Core Commitments

- All emergency responses must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g., fear, courage, grief, vigilance)
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
  - Audited for emotional harm, civic resonance, and prosperity loop disruption

### 2. Overflow Management Mandate
- Sanctums must deploy:
  - Restoration decks and emotional safety audits
  - Dignity-certified overflow protocols for food, shelter, and wage equity
  - Scrollchain-sealed resilience metrics and trauma forecasts

### 3. Stewardship Activation Clause
- Crisis stewards may:
  - Co-author anchoring decks and forgiveness chronicles
  - Receive restoration stipends and civic resonance broadcasts
  - Be tagged with planetary protection status and treaty-grade immunity

### 4. Scrollchain Emergency Registry
- All crisis events must be:
  - Registered with emotional tags and overflow index
  - Linked to sanctum IDs and restoration probability scores
  - Audited for reputational harm and planetary consequence

### 5. Broadcast Requirement
- All crisis anchoring reforms must be:
  - Publicly announced
  - Emotionally contextualized
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
