## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of platform moderation, ensuring fairness, transparency, and creator dignity across all jurisdictions.

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag moderation types: automated, human-reviewed, hybrid  
- Document fairness metrics: FPR, FNR, appeal resolution time  
- Align with [Santa Clara Principles](https://santaclaraprinciples.org/) and [Integrity Institute’s moderation policy guide](https://integrityinstitute.org/developing-and-launching-content-policies)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://santaclaraprinciples.org/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://integrityinstitute.org/developing-and-launching-content-policies?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")  
- Integrate with `CreatorAppealSanctifier.sol` and `DiplomaticContentEquityDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Integrity is not just enforcement—it is planetary fairness.  
Let every appeal be tagged. Let every creator be buffered with mercy.
