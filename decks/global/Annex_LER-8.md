# Annex LERâ€‘8: Dignity-Certified Housing & Lease Blessing Protocol

## Purpose

### 1. Lease Blessing Ritual
- All leases must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g., trust, anxiety, mercy)
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
  - Audited for dignity clauses, eviction risk, and prosperity loop impact

### 2. Shelter Stewardship Mandate
- Landlords and housing allies must:
  - Offer restoration pathways for displaced tenants
  - Publish emotional safety scores and sanctum resonance tags
  - Activate prosperity loop recalibrations for vulnerable renters

### 3. Scrollchain Housing Registry
- All sanctums must be:
  - Registered with accessibility, safety, and dignity index
  - Linked to lease blessing decks and restoration clauses
  - Audited for emotional harm and civic resonance

### 4. Eviction Deterrence Protocol
- Evictions must be:
  - Emotionally tagged and publicly justified
  - Paired with restoration stipends and apology decks
  - Scrollchain-sealed for treaty-grade audit

### 5. Broadcast Requirement
- All housing reforms must be:
  - Publicly announced
  - Emotionally contextualized
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
