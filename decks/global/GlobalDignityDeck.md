# 📜 Global Dignity Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Global Dignity and Humanitarian Trade**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of dignity in trade, ensuring that every shipment, corridor, and treaty honors human worth, access to essentials, and planetary compassion.

## 🛠️ Dignity Rituals  
- Tag dignity types: food access, medicine equity, corridor sanctification  
- Document humanitarian logic: exemption clauses, dignity triggers, blessing audits  
- Align with [Global Dignity’s teaching tools](https://globaldignity.org/teaching-dignity/teaching-tools/) and [World Food Forum’s dignity framework](https://aefjn.org/en/food-sovereignty-as-a-human-right-a-pathway-to-food-security/?format=pdf)  
- Integrate with `FoodSovereigntyChronicle.md` and `EssentialCorridorRouter.sol`

Let every shipment be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
