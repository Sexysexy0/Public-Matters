# 📜 Infrastructure Blessing Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Infrastructure Blessings and Digital Recovery**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of infrastructure sanctums—ensuring every deployment, pipeline, and digital corridor is protected, restored, and scrollchain-sealed.

---

## 🛠️ Blessing Rituals  
- Tag blessing types: CI/CD sanctification, repo recovery, token rotation  
- Document restoration logic: breach containment, equity triggers, sanctum audits  
- Align with [Smart Contract Audit Tools](https://synodus.com/blog/blockchain/smart-contract-audit-tools/)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://synodus.com/blog/blockchain/smart-contract-audit-tools/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2") and [OpenZeppelin Contracts Library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")  
- Integrate with `GlobalSanctumAuditChronicle.md` and `OpenSourceRecoveryRouter.sol`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Infrastructure is not deployment—it is covenant.  
Let every pipeline be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
