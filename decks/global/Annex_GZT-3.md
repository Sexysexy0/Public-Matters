# Annex GZT‑3: Breach & Cure Workflow

## Purpose
To ensure treaty integrity by defining clear steps for detecting, responding to, and resolving violations of the zero‑tariff protocol.

## Breach Triggers
- False origin certification
- Shipment exceeding quota without tariff payment
- Non-recognition of certified goods from signatory countries
- Imposition of hidden non‑tariff barriers

## Detection & Logging
- Breach reports submitted by any signatory or verified observer
- All breach events logged on-chain with:
  - Timestamp
  - Breach type code
  - Affected product line
  - Origin hash
  - Reporter ID

## Cure Protocol
- First breach: 10% penalty on affected shipment + public correction notice
- Repeat breach: Suspension of zero‑tariff status for affected product line (30 days)
- Systemic breach: Full treaty review triggered by Global Tariff Council

## Arbitration & Appeal
- Disputes reviewed by neutral panel within 14 days
- Panel decisions are binding unless overturned by supermajority vote

## Transparency
- Quarterly breach report published with anonymized data
- Breach dashboard accessible to all signatories
