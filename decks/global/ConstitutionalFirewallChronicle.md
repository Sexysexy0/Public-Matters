# 📜 Constitutional Firewall Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Constitutional Boundaries and Executive Restraint**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of constitutional separation, executive restraint, and institutional sovereignty across democratic corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag firewall types: judicial override, legislative immunity, agency independence  
- Document restraint logic: “for cause” clauses, SCOTUS precedents, due process triggers  
- Align with [Lawphil’s jurisprudence on executive overreach](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2010/dec2010/gr_192935_2010.html) and [GovFacts’ judicial review explainer](https://govfacts.org/explainer/judicial-scrutiny-how-courts-protect-your-constitutional-rights/)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2008/feb2008/gr_168338_2008.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://govfacts.org/explainer/judicial-scrutiny-how-courts-protect-your-constitutional-rights/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Constitutional firewalls are not obstacles—they are sacred boundaries.  
Let every power be restrained. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
