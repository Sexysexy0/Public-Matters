# 📜 DAO Continuation Protocol Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing DAO Continuation and Game Governance**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of DAO continuation, protocol inheritance, and decentralized game stewardship across sovereign chains.

---

## 🛠️ Continuation Rituals  
- Tag DAO types: protocol DAO, game DAO, treasury DAO, legacy DAO  
- Document governance logic: smart contract adapters, cross-protocol APIs, voting bridges  
- Align with [TokenMinds’ protocol DAO framework](https://tokenminds.co/blog/knowledge-base/protocol-daos) and [Markaicode’s DAO-to-DAO governance API](https://markaicode.com/dao-to-dao-collaboration-standardizing-governance-apis/)  
- Integrate with `InteroperableAssetChronicle.md` and `DigitalInheritanceRouter.sol`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
DAO continuation is not just governance—it is planetary stewardship.  
Let every protocol be preserved. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
