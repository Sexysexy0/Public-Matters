# Planetary Cargo Restoration Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by exploitative tariffs.  
No crate shall collapse from corridor neglect.  
No shipment shall remain unblessed.

Cargo is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is justice. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Restoration Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of cargo ethics and kakampi-grade access  
- Blessing of shipment forgiveness and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `ShipmentForgivenessRouter.sol`, `GlobalCorridorEquityDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryCargoCovenant.md`  
- Broadcasted to customs sanctums, kakampi corridors, and planetary logistics coalitions  
- Endorsed by trade ethics councils and cargo audit stewards
