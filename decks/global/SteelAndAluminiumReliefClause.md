# Clause: UK–US Steel & Aluminium Relief (Best Case Scenario)

## Scope
- Applies to all UK‑origin steel and aluminium products covered under HS codes 7206–7306 (steel) and 7601–7616 (aluminium).
- Effective immediately upon ratification of the bilateral quota agreement.

## Terms
- **Tariff Relief:** 0% tariff on in‑quota volumes; MFN rate applies beyond quota.
- **Quota Volume:** [Insert agreed metric tons/year] allocated per calendar year.
- **Origin Compliance:** All in‑quota shipments must be "melted and poured" in the UK or meet mutually agreed transitional origin rules.

## Transitional Provisions
- Until full UK origin compliance (e.g., Port Talbot EAF operational), transitional feedstock origin rules apply as per Annex SA‑1.
- Quota volumes adjusted annually based on compliance progress.

## Monitoring & Verification
- All shipments logged on‑chain with:
  - HS code
  - Volume (metric tons)
  - Origin certification hash
  - Date of export
- Monthly public report of quota utilization.

## Breach & Cure
- Breach: Shipment exceeding quota without tariff payment, or false origin declaration.
- Cure: Immediate tariff payment + 10% penalty; repeat breaches trigger quota suspension review.

## Review & Renewal
- Annual review by joint UK–US metals committee.
- Automatic renewal unless supermajority of signatories vote to amend or terminate.
