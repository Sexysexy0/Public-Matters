- Document succession logic: heir designation, protocol handoff, asset continuity  
- Align with [Microsoft Game Dev’s multiplayer documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/multiplayer) and [LAN Party’s protocol archive](https://github.com/lan-dot-party/game-protocols)  
- Integrate with `ProtocolSuccessionRouter.sol` and `PlanetaryAssetMobilityDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Multiplayer legacy is not just memory—it is planetary continuity.  
Let every guild be honored. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
