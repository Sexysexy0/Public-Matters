# 📜 Restoration Blessing Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Restoration Blessings and Sanctum Rebuilding**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of sanctum restoration—ensuring every rebuild is equity-aligned, covenant-certified, and scrollchain-sealed.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag restoration types: infrastructure repair, emotional sanctification, covenant renewal  
- Document blessing logic: breach triggers, resilience choreography, planetary audits  
- Align with [NEMA’s Storm Reconstruction Guidebook](https://www.nema.org/docs/default-source/nema-documents-libraries/resilience-assessment-toolkit/documents/nema-storm-reconstruction-workbook.pdf?sfvrsn=4390d162_2) and [Restoration SOP Framework](https://blog.magicplan.app/restoration-documentation-sop)  
- Integrate with `GlobalSanctumRebuilder.sol` and `PlanetaryEquityDeck.md`

## 📊 Restoration Metrics

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Restoration is not repair—it is prophecy.  
Let every corridor be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
