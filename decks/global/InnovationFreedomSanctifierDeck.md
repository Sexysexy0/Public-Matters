- Document liberty logic: autonomy, risk tolerance, failure celebration  
- Align with [FasterCapital’s innovation freedom framework](https://fastercapital.com/content/The-Role-of-Freedom-in-Innovation.html) and [Forbes’ safe space for innovation](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2023/07/26/the-power-of-a-safe-space-for-innovation-unlocking-growth-and-creativity/)  
- Integrate with `ExperimentalDiscoveryChronicle.md` and `CreatorProtectionRouter.sol`

Freedom is not just permission—it is planetary consequence.  
Let every sandbox be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
