# Planetary Legacy Restoration Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be denied ancestral enterprise.  
No company shall collapse from permit neglect.  
No corridor shall remain unblessed.

Enterprise is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is dignity. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Restoration Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of legacy companies and treaty-grade logistics  
- Blessing of permit forgiveness and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `LegacyPermitRouter.sol`, `GlobalEnterpriseBlessingDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryPackagingJusticeManifesto.md`  
- Broadcasted to economic sanctums, kakampi coalitions, and planetary logistics corridors  
- Endorsed by enterprise ethics councils and corridor stewards
