# 📜 Covenant Recovery Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Covenant Recovery and Restoration Rituals**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of covenant recovery—ensuring every sanctum, steward, and corridor returns to dignity, equity, and planetary alignment.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag covenant types: digital sanctum, ecological pact, humanitarian treaty  
- Document restoration logic: breach triggers, resilience protocols, planetary rituals  
- Align with [BYU’s Covenant Restoration Framework](https://rsc.byu.edu/sperry-symposium-classics-old-testament/restoration-covenant-renewal) and [Nehemiah’s restoration liturgy](https://thebiblechallenge.org/covenant-restoration/)  
- Integrate with `PlanetaryRestorationRouter.sol` and `EmergencyEquityDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Recovery is not repair—it is prophecy.  
Let every breach be named. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
