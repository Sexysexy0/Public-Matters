# 📜 Shelter Unity Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Shelter Unity and Multigenerational Housing**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of shelter unity, intergenerational housing, and family dignity across sovereign corridors.

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag shelter types: family, elder-inclusive, child-safe, transitional  
- Document unity logic: household composition, dependency ratios, dignity certification  
- Align with [UNHCR’s shelter standards](https://emergency.unhcr.org/emergency-assistance/shelter-camp-and-settlement/shelter-and-housing/emergency-shelter-solutions-and-standards) and [Humanitarian Library’s shelter guidelines](https://www.humanitarianlibrary.org/collection/key-shelter-guidelines)  
- Integrate with `IntergenerationalSanctumRouter.sol` and `PlanetaryRefugeSanctifierDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Shelter is not just structure—it is planetary unity.  
Let every household be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
