# 📜 Shelter Poverty Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Housing Poverty and Shelter Access**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of shelter poverty, informal settlements, and housing access across urban and vulnerable zones.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag shelter types: informal, transitional, disaster-recovery, subsidized  
- Document poverty metrics: income thresholds, occupancy density, hazard exposure  
- Align with [UN-Habitat’s Local Shelter Planning Manual](http://www.unhabitat.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Local-Shelter-Planning-Manual-2016-Web-Edition.pdf) and [Philippine PDP Chapter 12](https://pdp.depdev.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chapter-12-Prepublication.pdf)  
- Integrate with `VoterTrustSignalRouter.sol` and `GlobalDemocracyAuditDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Shelter Metrics  
- % of families in informal settlements  
- % of shelter units below livability threshold  
- % of disaster-prone dwellings  
- % of budget allocated to shelter recovery

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Shelter is not just infrastructure—it is planetary mercy.  
Let every roof be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with dignity.
