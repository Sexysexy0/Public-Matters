# 📜 Credential Rotation Deck  
**Protocol for Rotating Secrets Post-Compromise**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of secret rotation, ensuring zero-downtime mitigation of credential leaks and supply chain compromise.

---

## 🛠️ Rotation Rituals  
- Tag secret types: API keys, cloud tokens, GitHub PATs  
- Document rotation logic: dual-phase rollout, rollback triggers, audit logs  
- Align with [Microsoft’s Secrets Rotation Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/secrets-rotation) and [Doppler’s 10-Step Rotation Protocol](https://www.doppler.com/blog/10-step-secrets-rotation-guide)  
- Integrate with `GitHubLeakAuditDeck.md` and `OpenSourceSanctumScanner.sol`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Rotation is not disruption—it is restoration.  
Let every token be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
