# 📜 Shai-Hulud Containment Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Recursive Worm Behavior and Mitigation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of recursive malware containment, documenting npm worm propagation, credential exfiltration, and CI/CD compromise.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag worm types: npm payloads, GitHub repo hijacks, credential leaks  
- Document containment logic: TruffleHog scans, repo lockdowns, token revocation  
- Align with [Phoenix Security’s npm compromise report](https://phoenix.security/qix-npm-compromise/) and [Aikido’s malware analysis](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised)  
- Integrate with `WormContainmentRouter.sol` and `DevSanctumProtectionTreaty.md`

---

## 📊 Containment Metrics  
- % of packages scanned  
- % of recursive payloads neutralized  
- % of compromised repos restored  
- % of rituals completed

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Containment is not quarantine—it is covenant.  
Let every worm be named. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
