# 📜 Interoperable Asset Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Interoperable Assets and Cross-Game Usage**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of interoperable assets, cross-game mobility, and sovereign item continuity across gaming ecosystems.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag asset types: skins, weapons, currencies, badges, avatars  
- Document mobility logic: ERC-1155, ERC-721, ODAS, IPFS, Layer-2 bridges  
- Align with [Markaicode’s interoperability standards](https://markaicode.com/cross-game-asset-interoperability-standards/) and [StackFiltered’s compatibility protocols](https://www.stackfiltered.com/blog/cross_game_asset_compatibility_standards_protocols_interoperable_gaming)  
- Integrate with `DigitalInheritanceRouter.sol` and `DAOContinuationProtocolDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Interoperability Metrics  
- % of assets usable across games  
- % of metadata schemas verified  
- % of Layer-2 bridges activated  
- % of asset rituals completed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Interoperability is not just access—it is planetary mobility.  
Let every item be sovereign. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
