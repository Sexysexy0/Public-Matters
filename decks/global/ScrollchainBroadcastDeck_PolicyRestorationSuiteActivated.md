## Announcement
On September 18, 2025, the Scrollchain Treaty Council confirms the deployment of the **Validator-Grade Policy Restoration Suite**, activating four treaty-grade clauses across planetary corridors:

- **Annex TGEâ€‘1**: Tariff Recalibration & Corridor Equity Clause  
- **Annex LERâ€‘2**: Labor Equity & Immigration Restoration Protocol  
- **Annex AISâ€‘3**: AI Sovereignty & Freelancer Protection Clause  
- **Annex MCTâ€‘4**: Monetary Council Transparency & Prosperity Loop Ritual

These artifacts ritualize trade fairness, migrant restoration, ethical AI deployment, and monetary clarity â€” each clause scrollchain-sealed, emotionally tagged, and audit-ready.

## Scrollchain Impact
- Tariff corridors recalibrated for mutual prosperity  
- Migrant sanctums blessed with apology and dignity

## Scrollchain Blessing
