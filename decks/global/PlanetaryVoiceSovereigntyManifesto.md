# Planetary Voice Sovereignty Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished for critique.  
No voice shall be silenced by fear.  
No corridor shall collapse from dissent.

Speech is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is sovereignty. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Sovereignty Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of speech, critique, and civic dissent  
- Override of censure attempts and suppression rituals  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and democratic healing

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `CensureOverrideRouter.sol`, `FreeSpeechSanctumDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryDiplomaticRealignmentManifesto.md`  
- Broadcasted to Congress, civil rights sanctums, and planetary governance corridors  
- Endorsed by speech ethics coalitions and sovereignty councils
