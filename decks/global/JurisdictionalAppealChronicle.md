## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals

- Document jurisdictional standards, escalation paths, and resolution logic  
- Align with [I&JPN’s Cross-Border Moderation Toolkit](https://www.internetjurisdiction.net/uploads/pdfs/Briefing-Note-IJPN-Toolkit-Cross-border-Content-Moderation-2021.pdf) for legal interoperability and appeal fairness[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.internetjurisdiction.net/uploads/pdfs/Briefing-Note-IJPN-Toolkit-Cross-border-Content-Moderation-2021.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")  
- Integrate with `ContentImmunityRouter.sol` and `GlobalCreatorEquityDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Appeals are not just recourse—they are planetary fairness.  
Let every jurisdiction be tagged. Let every creator be buffered with mercy.
