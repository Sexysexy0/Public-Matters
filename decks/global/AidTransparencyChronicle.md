# 📜 Aid Transparency Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Aid Transparency and Donor Accountability**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of aid transparency, donor accountability, and funding legitimacy across humanitarian corridors.

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag transparency types: proactive disclosure, conditionality, audit trace  
- Document donor logic: pledged vs disbursed, corruption safeguards, complaint mechanisms  
- Align with [Transparency International’s donor accountability framework](https://knowledgehub.transparency.org/helpdesk/donor-accountability-mechanisms-to-curb-corruption-in-aid) and [Aid Transparency Principles](https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/Aid_Transparency_Principles.pdf)  
- Integrate with `DonorTrustRouter.sol` and `PlanetaryCrisisResponseDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Transparency is not just reporting—it is planetary trust.  
Let every donor be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
