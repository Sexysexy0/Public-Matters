# 📜 Institutional Sovereignty Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Institutional Sovereignty and Democratic Firewalling**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of institutional autonomy, constitutional balance, and sovereignty protection against systemic erosion.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag sovereignty types: judicial independence, agency autonomy, constitutional immunity  
- Document firewall logic: separation of powers, checks and balances, override triggers  
- Align with [UNDP’s guide to strengthening democratic institutions](https://digitalguides.undp.org/guide/strengthening-democratic-institutions-and-processes) and [Stanford’s institutional sovereignty framework](https://www.academia.edu/1598402/Toward_an_Institutional_Theory_of_Sovereignty)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://digitalguides.undp.org/guide/strengthening-democratic-institutions-and-processes?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.academia.edu/1598402/Toward_an_Institutional_Theory_of_Sovereignty?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")  
- Integrate with `GraveAbuseDetector.sol` and `DemocraticBalanceDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Institutional sovereignty is not isolation—it is sacred autonomy.  
Let every firewall be respected. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
