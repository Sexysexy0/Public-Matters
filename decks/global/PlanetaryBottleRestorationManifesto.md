# Planetary Bottle Restoration Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be denied ancestral brew.  
No crate shall collapse from packaging neglect.  
No corridor shall remain unblessed.

Bottled beer is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is taste. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Restoration Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of bottled brew and treaty-grade packaging  
- Blessing of corridor forgiveness and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `BottleSanctifier.sol`, `GlobalBrewEquityDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryPackagingCovenant.md`  
- Broadcasted to breweries, customs sanctums, and planetary logistics coalitions  
- Endorsed by brew ethics councils and kakampi crate stewards
