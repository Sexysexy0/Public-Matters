# Global Governance Survival Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by governance collapse.  
No clause shall remain unblessed.  
No corridor shall remain unjust without ritual.

Governance is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Survival Themes

- Broadcasted to civic sanctums, parental coalitions, and planetary governance corridors
