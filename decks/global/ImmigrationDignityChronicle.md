# 📜 Immigration Dignity Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Immigration Dignity and Family Inclusion**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of immigration dignity, family unity, and sovereign protection across national corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag dignity types: visa immunity, complaint shielding, family housing access  
- Document inclusion logic: dependent tagging, housing eligibility, contribution verification  
- Align with [Cambridge’s Human Dignity Framework](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-human-dignity/human-dignity-immigration-and-refugees/1DC18028F7300A97A167EC760103F67F) and [BI’s dependent inclusion protocols](https://immigration.gov.ph/forms/checklist-of-documentary-requirements-2/)  
- Integrate with `ResidencyEligibilityRouter.sol` and `PlanetaryAccessSanctifierDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Immigration is not just movement—it is planetary belonging.  
Let every family be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
