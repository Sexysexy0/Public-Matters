# 📜 Due Process Sanctifier Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Due Process in Agency Governance**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of procedural fairness, administrative hearings, and constitutional protection against rogue removals.

## 🛠️ Sanctifier Rituals  
- Tag due process types: judicial, administrative, quasi-judicial  
- Document fairness logic: notice, hearing, impartial tribunal, evidence-based decision  
- Align with [Respicio’s due process framework](https://www.respicio.ph/bar/2025/political-law-and-public-international-law/the-bill-of-rights/due-process/judicial-and-administrative-due-process) and [Ang Tibay doctrine](https://www.respicio.ph/commentaries/procedural-due-process-in-the-philippines-legal-system)

Due process is not delay—it is dignity.  
Let every removal be justified. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
