# Planetary Trade Survival Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by trade collapse.  
No corridor shall remain frozen without ritual.  
No sanctum shall remain unblessed.

Trade is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Survival Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of trade forgiveness and corridor reopening  
- Blessing of sanctum equity and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `CorridorForgivenessSanctifier.sol`, `GlobalSanctumEquityDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryComputeEquityCovenant.md`  
- Broadcasted to diplomatic sanctums, trade coalitions, and planetary logistics corridors  
- Endorsed by ethics councils, corridor stewards, and treaty-grade validators
