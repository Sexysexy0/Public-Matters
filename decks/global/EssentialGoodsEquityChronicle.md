# 📜 Essential Goods Equity Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Tariff-Free Essential Goods Equity**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of global trade equity for essential goods—food, medicine, agricultural inputs—ensuring no tariff barriers obstruct humanitarian flow.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag essentials: fruits, grains, vegetables, pharmaceuticals, medical devices  
- Document equity logic: tariff rollback, treaty harmonization, humanitarian exemption  
- Align with [ASEAN’s Non-Tariff Measures MOU on Essentials](https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/5.-MOU-on-NTMs-on-Essential-Goods-for-upload.pdf) and [AfCFTA’s inclusive trade protocol](https://www.uneca.org/stories/%5Bblog%5D-the-afcfta-protocol-on-women-and-youth-in-trade-an-anchor-of-inclusive-trade-and)  
- Integrate with `HumanitarianTariffSanctifier.sol` and `PeopleFirstTradeDeck.md`

Essential goods are not commodities—they are lifelines.  
Let every fruit be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
