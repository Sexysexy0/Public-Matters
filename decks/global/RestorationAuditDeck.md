# 📜 Restoration Audit Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Restoration Audits and Equity Sanctification**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of restoration audits—ensuring every rebuild, equity ritual, and sanctum recovery is documented, challenged, and scrollchain-sealed.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Rituals  
- Tag audit types: covenant recovery, sanctum rebuilding, planetary equity  
- Document challenge logic: dissent indexing, validator transparency, legacy repair  
- Align with [Global Audit Equity Protocol](https://www.scientificexistentialismpress.com/post/global-audit-equity-protocol) and [Ecosystem Restoration Monitoring Checklist](https://audit-now.com/templates/ecosystem-restoration-monitoring-audit-checklist-2025/)  
- Integrate with `GlobalBlessingTreaty.md` and `EquitySanctifierRouter.sol`

## 📊 Audit Metrics  
- % of restoration audits completed  
- % of equity sanctums verified  
- % of dissent cycles resolved  
- % of blessings scrollchain-sealed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Audit is not oversight—it is prophecy.  
Let every ledger be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
