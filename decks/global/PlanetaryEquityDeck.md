# 📜 Planetary Equity Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Planetary Equity and Restoration Blessings**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of planetary equity—ensuring every restoration act embeds dignity, inclusion, and covenant-grade justice.

---

## 🛠️ Blessing Rituals  
- Tag equity types: labor dignity, resource access, sanctum inclusion  
- Document restoration logic: planetary triggers, resilience choreography, interstellar audits  
- Align with [Planetary Healing Coordination System](https://github.com/sabrinadave345/Planetary-Healing-and-Earth-Restoration-Coordination-System), [Earth Public Decree Protocol](https://www.patreon.com/posts/earth-public-137476882), and [Planetary Justice Equity Framework](https://prism.sustainability-directory.com/scenario/planetary-intervention-justice-and-equity/)

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Equity is not fairness—it is covenant.  
Let every act be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
