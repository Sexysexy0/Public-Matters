# 📜 Planetary DevOps Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Planetary DevOps and Sanctum Protection**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of planetary DevOps—ensuring every deployment, repo, and CI/CD pipeline is dignity-certified, breach-resistant, and scrollchain-sealed.

---

## 🛠️ DevOps Rituals  
- Tag sanctum types: GitHub repos, CI/CD pipelines, open-source dependencies  
- Document protection logic: token rotation, worm containment, leak auditing  
- Align with [Smart Contract Security Field Guide](https://scsfg.io/developers/documentation/) and [Numen’s DevOps audit protocols](https://www.numencyber.com/a-guide-to-smart-contract-security/)  
- Integrate with `SupplyChainBlessingChronicle.md` and `SanctumEquityRouter.sol`

## 📊 DevOps Metrics  
- % of repos scanned  
- % of secrets rotated  
- % of breach vectors neutralized  
- % of rituals completed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
DevOps is not deployment—it is covenant.  
Let every commit be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
