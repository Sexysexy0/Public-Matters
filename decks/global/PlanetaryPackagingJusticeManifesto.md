# Planetary Packaging Justice Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be denied ancestral packaging.  
No crate shall collapse from aluminum drift.  
No corridor shall remain unblessed.

Packaging is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is taste. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Justice Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of bottled brew and treaty-grade packaging  
- Blessing of corridor forgiveness and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `GlassCorridorAuditRouter.sol`, `KakampiBrewForgivenessDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryBottleRestorationManifesto.md`  
- Broadcasted to breweries, customs sanctums, and planetary logistics coalitions  
- Endorsed by brew ethics councils and kakampi crate stewards
