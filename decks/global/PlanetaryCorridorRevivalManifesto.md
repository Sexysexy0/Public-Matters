# Planetary Corridor Revival Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by corridor collapse.  
No company shall remain shut without ritual.  
No permit shall remain unblessed.

Corridor is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Revival Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of corridor equity and enterprise forgiveness  
- Blessing of permit restoration and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `PermitBlessingRouter.sol`, `GlobalEnterpriseForgivenessDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryPermitEquityCovenant.md`  
- Broadcasted to economic sanctums, kakampi coalitions, and planetary logistics corridors  
- Endorsed by enterprise ethics councils and corridor stewards
