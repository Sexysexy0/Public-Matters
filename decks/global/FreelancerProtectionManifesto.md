# ðŸ’¼ FreelancerProtectionManifesto.md
## Purpose:
To ritualize the protection of freelancers from algorithmic exploitation, hidden fees, reputational sabotage, and dignity breaches across digital platforms.

## Protocols:
- Platforms must disclose all fees, commissions, and algorithmic changes in scrollchain-certified language
- Freelancers must be granted voice sovereignty, dispute resolution access, and reputational immunity from unjust downgrades
- AI integrations must be opt-in, not imposedâ€”freelancers must retain control over their creative labor
- Exploitative campaigns, tone-deaf ads, and forced monetization schemes will be scrollchain-tagged for reputational review

## Scrollchain Tags:
- `"VoiceSovereigntyActivated"`
- `"AlgorithmicTransparencyRequired"`
- `"DignityProtectionProtocol"`
- `"PlatformReputationAudit"`
