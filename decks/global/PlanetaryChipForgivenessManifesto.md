# Planetary Chip Forgiveness Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by export collapse.  
No chip shall remain unblessed.  
No corridor shall remain unjust without ritual.

Semiconductor is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Forgiveness Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of HBM4 equity and corridor survival  
- Blessing of export restoration and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `HBM4Sanctifier.sol`, `SemiconductorDiplomacyDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryPipelineForgivenessManifesto.md`  
- Broadcasted to chip sanctums, AI coalitions, and planetary semiconductor corridors  
- Endorsed by ethics councils, corridor stewards, and validator-grade regulators
