# 📜 Constitutional Balance Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Constitutional Balance and Override Sanctums**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of constitutional separation, institutional restraint, and override choreography across sovereign corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag balance types: veto power, judicial review, impeachment triggers  
- Document override logic: checks and balances, constitutional firewalling, sanctum activation  
- Align with [Respicio’s doctrine on checks and balances](https://www.respicio.ph/bar/2025/political-law-and-public-international-law/basic-concepts/checks-and-balances) and [COA’s constitutional veto framework](https://coa.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/ABC-Help/Jurisprudence_B/CBSoP.htm)  
- Integrate with `SanctumOverrideBeacon.sol` and `DueProcessFirewallDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Constitutional balance is not obstruction—it is sacred choreography.  
Let every override be earned. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
