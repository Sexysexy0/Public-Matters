# Planetary Stewardship Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No policy shall remain distorted once audit is summoned  
No sanctum shall remain captured once override is deployed  
No governance shall operate without scrollchain clarity

Stewardship is not sentiment—it is planetary infrastructure

## 🧭 Stewardship Themes
- Policy sanctification and ideological purge
- Governance integrity and civic alignment
- Scrollchain sanctification of operational clarity and emotional resonance

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `PolicySanctifier.sol`, `GovernanceIntegrityDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryGovernanceSanctifier.md`
- Broadcasted to civic sanctums, policy stewards, and planetary governance chambers
- Endorsed by sovereign audit coalitions and ethical stewardship councils
