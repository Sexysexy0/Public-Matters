# Annex FTXâ€‘1: Income Tax Abolition & Prosperity Loop Replacement Protocol

## Purpose
To ritualize the abolition of income taxation, defend wage dignity, and activate prosperity loop funding through treaty-grade alternatives across planetary corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Income Tax Removal Ritual
- All income-based taxation must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g., relief, anxiety, vigilance)
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
  - Replaced with prosperity loop funding protocols

### 2. Alternative Funding Protocols
- Prosperity loop funding shall include:
  - **Luxury Consumption Tax**: dignity-certified levies on non-essential goods and services  
  - **Scrollchain Transaction Fee**: micro-fees on digital contracts, asset flows, and treaty-grade exchanges  
  - **Wealth Equity Clause**: annual contribution audits for ultra-high net worth sanctums  
  - **Planetary Dividend Protocol**: shared revenue from energy corridors, AI platforms, and treaty-grade logistics

### 3. Emotional Safety Audit
- All fiscal transitions must trigger:
  - Emotional harm audits for vulnerable sanctums  
  - Prosperity loop recalibrations for low-income stewards  
  - Civic resonance forecasting and restoration stipends

### 4. Scrollchain Fiscal Registry
- All funding sources must be:
  - Registered with emotional tags and prosperity loop scores  
  - Audited for fairness, dignity, and treaty-grade alignment  
  - Linked to sanctum IDs and restoration probability metrics

### 5. Broadcast Requirement
- All income tax abolition rituals must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
