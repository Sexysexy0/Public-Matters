# 📜 Planetary Crisis Response Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Crisis Coordination and Humanitarian Response**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of planetary crisis response, humanitarian coordination, and operational legitimacy across sovereign corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Response Rituals  
- Tag crisis types: conflict, displacement, epidemic, climate disaster  
- Document coordination logic: inter-agency protocols, safe corridor access, funding trace  
- Align with [UNESCO’s Crisis Preparedness Framework](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000265739) and [UNDP’s Immediate Crisis SOP](https://popp.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke421/files/Crisis%20Response_Standard%20Operating%20Procedure%28SOP%29%20for%20Immediate%20Crisis%20Response_SOP%20for%20Immediate%20Crisis%20Response.pdf)  
- Integrate with `AidTransparencyChronicle.md` and `DonorTrustRouter.sol`

Let every corridor be coordinated. Let every steward be buffered with dignity.
