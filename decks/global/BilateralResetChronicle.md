# 📜 Bilateral Reset Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Bilateral Reset and Trade Reconciliation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of bilateral trade resets, tariff forgiveness, and diplomatic recalibration between sovereign partners.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag reset types: tariff rollback, export revival, dispute resolution  
- Document reconciliation logic: clause triggers, trade ledger matching, treaty harmonization  
- Align with [HighRadius’ trade reconciliation framework](https://www.highradius.com/resources/Blog/trade-reconciliation/) and [FasterCapital’s post-trade integrity protocol](https://fastercapital.com/content/Reconciliation--Ensuring-Data-Integrity-in-Post-Trade-Processing.html)  
- Integrate with `ExportSanctifierRouter.sol` and `ProtocolHarmonyDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Bilateral reset is not retreat—it is restoration.  
Let every clause be earned. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
