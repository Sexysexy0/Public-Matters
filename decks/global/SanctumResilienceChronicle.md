# 📜 Sanctum Resilience Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Sanctum Resilience and Global Recovery**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of sanctum resilience—ensuring every steward, corridor, and infrastructure zone recovers with dignity, foresight, and planetary grace.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag resilience types: cyber breach recovery, climate disaster response, infrastructure restoration  
- Document recovery logic: resilience triggers, equity protocols, sanctum audits  
- Align with [RSA’s resilience documentation framework](https://www.rsaconference.com/library/blog/incident-response-documentation-building-for-resilience-not-just-recovery) and [NDRRMC’s Ready to Rebuild workbook](https://ndrrmc.gov.ph/attachments/article/4145/FOR_UPLOADING_Ready_to_Rebuild_Workbook_Feb24.pdf)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.rsaconference.com/library/blog/incident-response-documentation-building-for-resilience-not-just-recovery?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://ndrrmc.gov.ph/attachments/article/4145/FOR_UPLOADING_Ready_to_Rebuild_Workbook_Feb24.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")  
- Integrate with `GlobalRecoveryRouter.sol` and `CrisisBlessingDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Resilience is not resistance—it is prophecy.  
Let every breach be named. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
