# 📜 Onchain Legacy Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Onchain Legacy and Game Preservation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of digital legacy, game preservation, and posthumous asset continuity across sovereign chains.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag legacy types: NFT migration, DAO continuation, open-source release  
- Document preservation logic: heir designation, asset vaulting, unlock conditions  
- Align with [Legacy-Onchain’s genie NFT framework](https://github.com/skartik-sk/legacy-onchain) and [Chronicle Protocol’s verifiable data architecture](https://docs.chroniclelabs.org/understandingChronicle)  
- Integrate with `GamePreservationRouter.sol` and `PlanetaryGamingEquityDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Legacy is not just memory—it is planetary inheritance.  
Let every game be preserved. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
