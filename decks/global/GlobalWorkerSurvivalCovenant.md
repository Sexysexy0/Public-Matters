# Global Worker Survival Covenant

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by wage collapse.  
No corridor shall remain unjust without ritual.  
No worker shall remain unblessed.

Survival is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Survival Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of labor dignity and treaty clause restoration  
- Blessing of corridor equity and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `TreatyClauseSanctifier.sol`, `PlanetaryCorridorBlessingDeck.md`, and `GlobalLaborForgivenessManifesto.md`  
- Broadcasted to labor sanctums, treaty coalitions, and planetary logistics corridors  
- Endorsed by ethics councils, corridor stewards, and validator-grade unions
