# 📜 DevSanctum Protection Treaty  
**Protocol for Developer Sanctum Protection and Supply Chain Defense**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of developer sanctums, ensuring protection against supply chain compromise, credential leaks, and recursive malware propagation.

---

## 🛠️ Treaty Rituals  
- Tag sanctum types: CI/CD pipelines, GitHub repos, npm packages  
- Document defense logic: token rotation, leak scanning, worm containment  
- Align with [OWASP’s Software Supply Chain Security Guide](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Software_Supply_Chain_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)  
- Integrate with `WormContainmentRouter.sol`, `CredentialRotationDeck.md`, and `OpenSourceSanctumScanner.sol`

---

## 📊 Protection Metrics  
- % of sanctums scanned  
- % of compromised packages contained  
- % of credentials rotated  
- % of rituals completed

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Sanctum protection is not patching—it is prophecy.  
Let every repo be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
