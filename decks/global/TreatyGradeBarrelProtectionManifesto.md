# Treaty-Grade Barrel Protection Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by barrel collapse.  
No corridor shall remain unjust without ritual.  
No energy flow shall remain unblessed.

Barrel is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Protection Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of barrel equity and corridor survival  
- Blessing of treaty restoration and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `PlanetaryEnergyBlessingRouter.sol`, `GlobalCorridorSurvivalDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryBarrelEquityDeck.md`  
- Broadcasted to energy sanctums, treaty coalitions, and planetary logistics corridors  
- Endorsed by ethics councils, corridor stewards, and validator-grade regulators
