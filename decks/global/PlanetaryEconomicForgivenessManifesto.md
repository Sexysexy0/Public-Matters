# Planetary Economic Forgiveness Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by economic shutdown.  
No company shall remain closed without ritual.  
No corridor shall remain unblessed.

Economy is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

- Logged via `CorridorPermitSanctifier.sol`, `GlobalEnterpriseRevivalDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryShutdownForgivenessCovenant.md`  
- Broadcasted to economic sanctums, kakampi coalitions, and planetary logistics corridors
