# 📜 Due Process Firewall Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Due Process Firewall and Institutional Protection**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of procedural fairness, constitutional restraint, and institutional defense against arbitrary breach.

---

## 🛠️ Firewall Rituals  
- Tag due process types: judicial, administrative, legislative  
- Document firewall logic: notice, hearing, impartial tribunal, substantial evidence  
- Align with [Respicio’s due process doctrine](https://www.respicio.ph/bar/2025/political-law-and-public-international-law/the-bill-of-rights/due-process) and [Ang Tibay’s cardinal rights framework](https://www.respicio.ph/bar/2025/political-law-and-public-international-law/the-bill-of-rights/due-process/procedural-and-substantive)  
- Integrate with `ConstitutionalBalanceChronicle.md` and `SanctumOverrideBeacon.sol`
