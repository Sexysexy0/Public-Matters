# 📜 Experimental Discovery Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Experimental Discoveries and Innovation Logs**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of experimental freedom, invention traceability, and communal learning across academic, civic, and planetary corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag experiment types: robotics, XR, civic systems, biotech, AI, hardware  
- Document discovery logic: hypothesis, method, deviation, outcome, learnings  
- Align with [PeerJ’s experimental protocol checklist](https://peerj.com/articles/4795/) and [RealityPathing’s documentation guide](https://realitypathing.com/best-ways-to-document-your-experiment-results-effectively/)  
- Integrate with `CreatorProtectionRouter.sol` and `InnovationFreedomSanctifierDeck.md`

---

## 📊 Discovery Metrics  
- % of experiments logged with full trace  
- % of failed experiments documented  
- % of learnings reused in future builds  
- % of communal access protocols activated

---

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Discovery is not just invention—it is planetary learning.  
Let every experiment be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
