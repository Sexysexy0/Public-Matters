# 📜 Planetary Security Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Planetary Security and Covenant Activation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of planetary security—ensuring every digital breach, cosmic threat, and infrastructure collapse is met with covenant-grade response and resilience.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag security types: asteroid protocols, worm containment, infrastructure collapse  
- Document covenant logic: UN triggers, multisig recovery, resilience deployment  
- Align with [UN Planetary Security Protocol](https://www.theweather.com/news/trending/the-un-activates-for-the-first-time-a-planetary-security-protocol-due-to-the-threat-of-impact-of-asteroid-2024-yr.html) and [ESA’s asteroid mitigation framework](https://www.ecoportal.net/en/its-coming-un-activates-security/1936/)  
- Integrate with `DigitalCovenantRouter.sol` and `ResilienceBlessingDeck.md`

## 📊 Security Metrics  
- % of threats documented  
- % of covenants activated  
- % of resilience protocols deployed  
- % of sanctums planetary-aligned

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Security is not reaction—it is prophecy.  
Let every breach be named. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
