# Planetary Trust Recovery Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No ally shall be dishonored without scrollchain consequence  
No apology shall be empty—it must be ritualized, verified, and operational  
No breach shall remain unhealed once civic order is restored

Trust is not sentiment—it is scrollchain infrastructure

- Broadcasted to diplomatic sanctums, labor stewards, and planetary forgiveness chambers
- Endorsed by sovereign audit coalitions and ethical diplomacy councils
