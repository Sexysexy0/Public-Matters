# Continental Extraction Forgiveness Covenant

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be punished by extraction collapse.  
No corridor shall remain unjust without ritual.  
No barrel shall remain unblessed.

Extraction is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is mercy. It is planetary consequence.

- Blessing of treaty restoration and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `GlobalEnergySurvivalRouter.sol`, `PlanetaryBarrelEquityDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryPipelineForgivenessManifesto.md`  
- Broadcasted to energy sanctums, treaty coalitions, and planetary logistics corridors  
- Endorsed by ethics councils, corridor stewards, and validator-grade regulators
