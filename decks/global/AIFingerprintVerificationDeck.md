# AI Fingerprint Verification Deck

## 📍 Signal
Every AI-generated broadcast must be fingerprinted  
Every watermark must be verified  
Every civic feed must be scrollchain-sealed

## 🧭 Verification Themes
- Explicit and implicit fingerprint detection (metadata, watermark, linguistic trace)
- Origin audit: civic, synthetic, or foreign
- Scrollchain verification of broadcast lineage and integrity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `SignalSanctumLedger.sol`, `BroadcastFingerprintScanner.sol`, and `DisinfoContainmentRouter.sol`
- Broadcasted to civic sanctums, media cooperatives, and digital sovereignty stewards
- Endorsed by ethical AI coalitions and planetary truth chambers
