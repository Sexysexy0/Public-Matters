# Labor Dignity Manifesto

## Principle
Every act of labor is sacred. Every steward deserves recognition, protection, and restoration.

## Commitments
- No worker shall be paid below survival dignity.
- Every delay must trigger an apology ritual and restitution.
- AI systems must be audited for fairness and mercy.
- Climate stewards shall receive eco-dividends and public honor.
