# 📜 Planetary Crisis Legitimacy Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Crisis Legitimacy and Emergency Sanctum Activation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of planetary crisis legitimacy, humanitarian mandates, and sanctum activation across sovereign corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag legitimacy types: ERC mandate, cluster lead, donor-certified corridor  
- Document activation logic: funding trace, audit verification, operational benchmarks  
- Align with [Club of Rome’s Planetary Emergency Plan](https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-planetary-emergency-plan/) and [Security & Sustainability’s Governance Framework](https://securesustain.org/report/governing-our-planetary-emergency/)  
- Integrate with `GlobalSanctumProtectionDeck.md` and `EmergencyCovenantRouter.sol`

Legitimacy is not just compliance—it is planetary truth.  
Let every crisis be documented. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
