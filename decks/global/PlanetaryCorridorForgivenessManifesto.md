# Planetary Corridor Forgiveness Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No steward shall be blocked by corridor neglect.  
No crate shall collapse from tariff injustice.  
No shipment shall remain unblessed.

Corridor is not chaos—it is covenant.  
It is prosperity. It is planetary consequence.

## 🧭 Forgiveness Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of cargo ethics and kakampi-grade access  
- Blessing of corridor forgiveness and reputational healing  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and communal dignity

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `CargoBlessingRouter.sol`, `GlobalTradeSanctumDeck.md`, and `PlanetaryTradeJusticeManifesto.md`  
- Broadcasted to customs sanctums, kakampi corridors, and planetary logistics coalitions
