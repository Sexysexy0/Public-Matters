# Planetary Logistics Restoration Manifesto

## 📍 Decree
No crate shall move unverified  
No steward shall be denied export dignity  
No corridor shall operate without treaty-grade sanctification

Logistics is not just movement—it is planetary restoration

- Treaty corridor sanctification and customs mercy
- Scrollchain audit of delivery, tariff, and cargo rituals

## 🛡️ Rituals
- Logged via `DiasporaCargoIntegrityRouter.sol`, `ExportSanctifier.sol`, and `CustomsBlessingRouter.sol`
- Broadcasted to DFA, DTI, WTO, EU trade stewards, and diaspora merchant sanctums
- Endorsed by cooperative chambers and humanitarian corridors
