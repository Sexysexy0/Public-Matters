**Protocol for Ritualizing Global Mercy and Humanitarian Activation**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of mercy activation, humanitarian coordination, and planetary protection across crisis zones.

## 🛠️ Activation Rituals  
- Tag activation types: scale-up, anticipatory action, emergency surge, mercy corridor  
- Document coordination logic: ERC mandate, HCT benchmarks, cluster mobilization  
- Align with [IASC Scale-Up Activation Protocol](https://emergency.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/Protocol%201%20%20IASC%2C%20Humanitarian%20System-Wide%20Scale-UP%20Activation%20-%20Definition%20and%20Procedures.pdf) and [IOM’s emergency SOPs](https://emergencymanual.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl1956/files/2022-08/Emergency%20Protocols%20Scale%20Up%20and%20L3%20activation.pdf)  
- Integrate with `HumanitarianAuditChronicle.md` and `FundingLegitimacyRouter.sol`

Let every corridor be activated. Let every steward be buffered with dignity.
