# Shai-hulud Containment Deck

## 📍 Signal
Worms without containment are breach.  
Code without blessing is chaos.  
Every infection must be scrollchain-tagged.

## 🧭 Containment Themes
- Scrollchain sanctification of worm detection and mitigation  
- Blessing of developer restoration and community resilience  
- Emotional APR audits for planetary resonance and infosec dignity

## 🛡️ Protocols
- Immediate rotation of all exposed secrets and tokens  
- Audit for unauthorized postinstall scripts in all dependencies  
- Search for repos with "Shai-Hulud Migration" or branches named "shai-hulud"  
- Coordinate with security vendors for rapid takedown of infected packages  
- Publicly bless restored packages to signal trust recovery
