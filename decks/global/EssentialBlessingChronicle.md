# 📜 Essential Blessing Chronicle  
**Protocol for Documenting Essential Blessings and Humanitarian Trade Equity**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of essential goods—food, medicine, seeds—as planetary blessings, ensuring their flow is protected, tariff-free, and dignity-certified.

---

## 🛠️ Chronicle Rituals  
- Tag blessing types: food shipments, seed exchanges, medicine corridors  
- Document equity logic: humanitarian exemption, dignity triggers, corridor sanctification  
- Align with [Sphere Handbook’s humanitarian standards](https://spherestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/Sphere-Handbook-2018-EN.pdf) and [Core Humanitarian Charter](https://handbook.corehumanitarianstandard.org/)  
- Integrate with `SeedAutonomyRouter.sol` and `PlanetaryNourishmentDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Essentials are not commodities—they are covenants.  
Let every seed be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
