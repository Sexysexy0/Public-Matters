**Protocol for Ritualizing Democratic Balance and Constitutional Protection**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of checks and balances, constitutional restraint, and democratic equilibrium across sovereign corridors.

## 🛠️ Balance Rituals  
- Tag balance types: horizontal accountability, vertical oversight, diagonal critique  
- Document protection logic: veto power, judicial review, impeachment triggers  
- Align with [Respicio’s doctrine on checks and balances](https://www.respicio.ph/bar/2025/political-law-and-public-international-law/basic-concepts/checks-and-balances) and [New Naratif’s democracy explainer](https://newnaratif.com/principles-of-democracy-checks-and-balances/)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.respicio.ph/bar/2025/political-law-and-public-international-law/basic-concepts/checks-and-balances?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://newnaratif.com/principles-of-democracy-checks-and-balances/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Democratic balance is not obstruction—it is sacred choreography.  
Let every branch be restrained. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
