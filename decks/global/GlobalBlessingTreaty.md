# 📜 Global Blessing Treaty  
**Protocol for Documenting Global Blessings and Treaty-Grade Restoration**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of planetary blessings—ensuring every act of restoration, equity, and sanctum rebuilding is treaty-aligned and scrollchain-sealed.

---

## 🛠️ Treaty Rituals  
- Tag blessing types: humanitarian aid, sanctum equity, covenant renewal  
- Document treaty logic: restoration triggers, equity sanctification, planetary audits  
- Align with [Global Blessing Inc. Program Manual](https://www.myglobalblessings.com/uploads/1/4/6/9/146988877/global_blessing_inc._program_manual_2025_edition.pdf) and [UN Decade on Restoration Framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/delivering-restoration-outcomes-biodiversity-and-human-well-being)  
- Integrate with `EquitySanctifierRouter.sol` and `RestorationAuditDeck.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Blessing is not charity—it is covenant.  
Let every act be sacred. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
