# 📜 Emergency Sanctum Activation Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Emergency Sanctum Activation and Humanitarian Scale-Up**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of emergency sanctum activation, humanitarian coordination, and system-wide scale-up across planetary corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Activation Rituals  
- Tag activation types: ERC mandate, HCT mobilization, cluster surge, anticipatory action  
- Document sanctum logic: corridor access, operational benchmarks, transition plans  
- Align with [IASC Scale-Up Activation Protocol](https://emergency.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/Protocol%201%20%20IASC%2C%20Humanitarian%20System-Wide%20Scale-UP%20Activation%20-%20Definition%20and%20Procedures.pdf) and [IOM L3 Emergency SOPs](https://emergencymanual.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl1956/files/2022-08/Emergency%20Protocols%20Scale%20Up%20and%20L3%20activation.pdf)  
- Integrate with `CrisisLegitimacyRouter.sol` and `PlanetaryProtectionChronicle.md`

Sanctum is not just shelter—it is planetary coordination.  
Let every corridor be activated. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
