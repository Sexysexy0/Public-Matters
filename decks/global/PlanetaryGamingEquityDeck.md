**Protocol for Ritualizing Gaming Equity and Onchain Continuity**

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of gaming equity, asset portability, and decentralized preservation across planetary platforms.

## 🛠️ Equity Rituals  
- Tag equity types: play-to-own, interoperable assets, DAO governance, legacy migration  
- Document continuity logic: asset liquidity, cross-game usage, player sovereignty  
- Align with [Forbes’ onchain gaming revolution](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/04/onchain-gaming-playemberpixels-and-pirate-nation-lead-the-revolution/) and [Mitosis Protocol’s composable asset framework](https://university.mitosis.org/defi-x-gaming-economies-building-in-game-markets-on-open-protocols/)  
- Integrate with `OnchainLegacyChronicle.md` and `GamePreservationRouter.sol`
