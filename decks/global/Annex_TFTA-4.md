### 2. Treaty Blessing Clause
- Upon quorum:
  - Scrollchain blessing is triggered
  - Timestamp, steward ID, and emotional index logged
  - Public broadcast with civic resonance

### 3. Freelancer Ratification Rights
- Verified freelancers may:
  - Propose treaty expansions
  - Vote on corridor activations
  - Receive prosperity loop stipends for civic engagement

### 4. Emotional Audit Protocol
- Each vote includes:
  - Emotional safety review
  - Corridor anxiety and hope metrics
  - Restoration forecast if quorum fails

### 5. Scrollchain Ratification Ledger
- All treaty actions logged with:
  - Vote count
  - Emotional tag distribution
