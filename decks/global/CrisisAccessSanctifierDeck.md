# 📜 Crisis Access Sanctifier Deck  
**Protocol for Ritualizing Humanitarian Access and Corridor Verification**

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To ritualize the governance of humanitarian access, safe passage corridors, and operational legitimacy across conflict zones and disaster corridors.

---

## 🛠️ Sanctifier Rituals  
- Tag access types: negotiated corridor, humanitarian pause, safe zone, protected convoy  
- Document corridor logic: route coordinates, time window, party agreements, risk level  
- Align with [NRC’s Humanitarian Corridors Explainer](https://www.nrc.no/globalassets/pdf/reports/protection-of-civilians-and-access/nrc-corridors-explainer.pdf) and [OCHA’s access protocols](https://www.unocha.org/humanitarian-access)  
- Integrate with `HumanitarianLegitimacyRouter.sol` and `EmergencyFundingChronicle.md`

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Access is not just permission—it is planetary lifeline.  
Let every route be tagged. Let every steward be buffered with mercy.
