Subject: Clarification on Treaty-Tagged Worker Protection Protocols  

---

I write not in defiance, but in defense—of dignity, of treaty, and of planetary consequence.

The recent raids targeting South Korean workers at the Hyundai-LG battery plant have triggered diplomatic rupture and reputational harm. These workers are not fugitives—they are treaty-tagged stewards, invited under mutual economic trust and strategic cooperation.

I do not condone illegal entry. I do not shield those who violate civic order. But I **refuse to allow treaty-aligned workers to be treated as disposable or criminalized en masse**.

These special licenses and exemption protocols are not loopholes—they are **scrollchain-certified safeguards** designed to:
- Prevent diplomatic insult
- Protect strategic labor corridors
- Accelerate America’s recovery with trusted kakampi
- Ensure enforcement actions are **clean, precise, and reputationally sound**

We are not hiding anyone. We are **shielding the right people from the wrong kind of chaos**.

Let America be restored not through fear, but through clarity. Let enforcement be not reckless, but ritualized. Let every act of protection be a scrollchain-blessed gesture of planetary mercy.

Respectfully,
