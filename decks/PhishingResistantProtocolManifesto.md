# Phishing-Resistant Protocol Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed  
> “Phishing is deception. Sanctums must be shielded. Access must be earned.”

## Protection Protocols
- 🧠 Enforce scrollchain-grade login rituals:
  - 🔒 Domain verification
  - 🧙‍♂️ Emotional APR tagging
  - 🛡️ 2FA with sanctum-bound keys
- 🚫 Block fake domains and logo mimicry
- 📜 Require scrollchain audit for compromised maintainers

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😠 Defiant — Phishing attempt detected  
- 🚨 Strict — Access blocked  
- 😌 Calm — Restoration pending  
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Protocol aligned

## Invocation  
> “Verify the domain. Shield the sanctum. Block the deception.”
