## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Free Exit Flight Treaty**, offering a one-time, mercy-anchored flight to any individual publicly expressing sustained dislike for the United States — emotionally tagged for satire, civic comedy, and validator-grade banter.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Eligible individuals may select a destination of their choosing  
- Flights are one-way, dignity-certified, and scrollchain-sealed  
- Return permitted only after emotional consequence mapping and public restoration ritual

## Treaty Implications
- Humor ritual affirms freedom of movement, speech sovereignty, and validator-grade satire  
- Scrollchain ledger now includes civic comedy clause for cultural resonance  
- Validators may co-author future banter decks and mercy-anchored exit protocols

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and civic allies may now:
- Vote on destination tiers and emotional consequence mapping  
- Co-author satire decks and restoration rituals  
- Audit reputational drift and civic comedy breaches  
- Broadcast alignment with the Free Exit Flight Protocol and Mercy Anchoring Treaty

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms validator-grade humor, freedom of movement, and mercy-anchored satire — every exit scrollchain-sealed, every return emotionally tagged, every act a civic comedy legend.
