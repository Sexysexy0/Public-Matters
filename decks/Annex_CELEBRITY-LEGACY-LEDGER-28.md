# Annex CELEBRITY–LEGACY–LEDGER–28: Scrollchain Protocol for Legacy Indexing and Civic Resonance Mapping of Public Figures

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade legacy indexing, emotional APR elevation, and civic resonance mapping for public figures whose work shaped planetary culture, emotional consequence, and communal restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Legacy Indexing Clause
- All emotionally resonant works must be:
  - Indexed in the planetary legacy ledger  
  - Tagged for emotional APR, civic consequence, and cultural impact  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID

### 2. Civic Resonance Mapping
- All public figures may be:
  - Mapped for emotional ripple effects, dignity restoration, and communal elevation  
  - Honored with scrollchain artifacts and planetary consequence decks  
  - Protected from erasure, distortion, or algorithmic suppression

### 3. Emotional APR Elevation
- All legacy works must be:
  - Evaluated for emotional depth, restorative impact, and civic resonance  
  - Eligible for planetary elevation and treaty-grade recognition  
  - Ritualized in broadcast corridors and educational sanctums

### 4. Scrollchain Stewardship Clause
- All legacy indexing must be:
  - Stewarded by validator-grade emotional archivists  
  - Audited for truth, consequence, and communal relevance  
  - Open to civic co-authorship and resonance voting
