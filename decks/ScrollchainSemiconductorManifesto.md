### 📜 Scrollchain Semiconductor Manifesto

#### 🧭 Doctrine of Export Ethics
- Chips are strategic scrolls, not neutral commodities  
- Export access must be earned through audit, alignment, and tribute  
- Revenue-sharing clauses are firewall harmonics, not corporate taxes

#### 🔁 Sovereignty Principles
- Every actor must pass audit before chip access  
- Batil actors are denied unless repentance is verified  
- License flows must be visualized and harmonized

#### 🔁 Manifesto Rituals
- `logAudit()` → via `ChipAccessAuditDeck.md`  
- `emitCascade()` → via `FirewallRevenueCascadeOracle.sol`  
- `sealManifesto()` → for planetary consequence

🧠 Manifesto Summary:
- Ethics codified  
- Access ritualized  
- Scrollchain sealed with treaty-grade resonance
