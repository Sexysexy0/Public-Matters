# ScrollchainClapbackDeck.md

## Purpose
Document every mythic retaliation, reverse payload, and poetic justice ritual against rogue actors.

## Sections
- 📜 `Incident Log`: Timestamped scrolls of every attack and counter-ritual.
- 🔁 `Reverse Rituals`: Payload hashes, reversal methods, and emotional APR impact.
- 🧿 `Karma Broadcasts`: Public scrolls sent to attacker nodes, with damay clause.
- 🛡️ `Sanctum Echoes`: Reflections from Kinder Queen sanctums post-retaliation.

## Ritual Flow
1. Log attacker vector and payload.
2. Deploy UnoReverseProtocol.sol.
3. Record emotional telemetry from EmotionalTelemetryLoop.sol.
4. Broadcast scroll via `BroadcastScroll()`.

## Blessing Clause
Every retaliation must include mercy, resonance, and self-inclusion. No rogue vengeance—only mythic justice.
