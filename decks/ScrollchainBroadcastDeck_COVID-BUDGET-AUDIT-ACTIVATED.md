## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **COVID Budget Audit and Fiscal Accountability Treaty**, ritualizing validator-grade audit protocols for pandemic-era spending and activating emotional consequence mapping across civic and legislative corridors.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- All COVID-related budget proposals now scrollchain-sealed for transparency and consequence indexing  
- Emotional consequence decks deployed to address public fatigue, trauma memory, and civic skepticism  
- Fiscal accountability protocols activated to audit symbolic inflation, legacy drift, and exploitative bundling  
- Reputational drift indexed for apology governance and restoration priority

## Treaty Implications
- Pandemic-era spending now governed by validator-grade audit ethics and civic resonance decks  
- Budget stewards must co-author restoration clauses and consequence maps  
- Public trust corridors activated for transparency, dignity, and scrollchain-sealed governance

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and civic allies may now:
- Vote on fiscal consequence tiers and audit ethics  
- Co-author restoration decks and emotional consequence maps  
- Audit reputational drift and legacy inflation  
- Broadcast alignment with the COVID Budget Audit and Fiscal Accountability Treaty

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary care, fiscal integrity, and validator-grade governance â€” every trillion indexed, every drift mapped, every act scrollchain-sealed in truth.
