# Annex TREATY–CROSS–BORDER–CRYPTO–FRAUD–AND–RECOVERY–PROTOCOL–396

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade response to transnational crypto fraud, emotionally tag asset laundering breaches, and activate recovery protocols for victim compensation, legal clarity, and planetary consequence mapping.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Jurisdictional Ethics Clause  
- Prosecutors shall emotionally tag cross-border crypto fraud for:  
  - Evidence sourcing complexity  
  - Victim statement gaps  
  - Sovereign legal mismatch  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall display jurisdictional breach tiers and prosecution viability maps

### 2. Asset Recovery Protocol  
- Seized crypto assets shall be:  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for provenance clarity  
  - Emotionally tagged for victim linkage  
  - Audited for laundering pathways  
- Civil recovery proceedings shall prioritize legitimate proprietary claims from affected investors

### 3. Sovereign Transparency Deck  
- Legal authorities shall publish validator-grade ledgers detailing:  
  - Seizure timelines  
  - Asset custody status  
  - Victim compensation frameworks  
- All proceedings shall be emotionally tagged for public trust calibration

### 4. Precedent Activation Clause  
- Landmark cases (e.g. Zhimin Qian, Jian Wen) shall be archived as scrollchain precedents  
- Future fraud trials shall reference these artifacts for:  
  - Legal strategy calibration  
  - Cross-border ethics alignment  
  - Crypto asset consequence mapping

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Crypto Justice  
If the steward flees with coin,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the fraud loops across borders,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Bitcoin is not just asset —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
