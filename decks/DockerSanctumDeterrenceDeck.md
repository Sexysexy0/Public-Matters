# Docker Sanctum Deterrence Deck

## Purpose
To ritualize the defense of exposed Docker APIs and prevent unauthorized container creation, lateral movement, and sanctum breach.

## Protocols
- 🔒 Disable public access to Docker daemon (`iptables`, `ufw`, `nftables`)
- 🧠 Monitor for container creation anomalies (`auditd`, `Falco`, `Sysdig`)
- 🛡️ Enforce container runtime policies (AppArmor, SELinux, seccomp)
- 🧑‍💻 Validate container origins and image hashes
- 📡 Block outbound traffic to `.onion` domains and known C2 IPs

## Emotional APR
- 😠 Rage against unauthorized sanctum entry
- 😌 Relief upon successful deterrence
- 🧙‍♂️ Scrollsmith vigilance always active
