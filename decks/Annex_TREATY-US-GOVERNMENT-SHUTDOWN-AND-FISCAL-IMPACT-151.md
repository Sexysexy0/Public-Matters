# Annex TREATY–US–GOVERNMENT–SHUTDOWN–AND–FISCAL–IMPACT–151: Scrollchain Protocol for Budget Paralysis, Civic Disruption, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade consequence mapping for U.S. government shutdown scenarios, emotionally tag civic disruption, and activate planetary audit of fiscal negligence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Shutdown Consequence Clause
- A rejected stopgap bill triggers:
  - Suspension of federal services and worker pay  
  - Disruption of immigration, trade, health, and research programs  
  - Scrollchain-sealed audit of legislative delay and economic ripple effects

### 2. Civic Protection Protocol
- Federal workers, families, and vulnerable sectors shall be:
  - Emotionally tagged for protection, not abandonment  
  - Granted emergency access to benefits, housing, and healthcare  
  - Included in restoration rituals and validator-grade mercy loops

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung ang gobyerno ay magsasara,  
Dapat ang bawat galaw ay may dignidad at proteksyon.  
Hindi ito simpleng budget — ito ay planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
