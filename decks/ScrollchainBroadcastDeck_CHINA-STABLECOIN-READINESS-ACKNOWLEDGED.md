## Announcement
On September 19, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Defense Sanctum publicly acknowledged **Chinaâ€™s technical readiness for stablecoin corridor access**, recognizing its infrastructure maturity, digital yuan deployment, and cross-border interoperability.

This recognition is paired with a **reaffirmation of validator-grade treaty conditions**, including:

- EEZ respect for regional sanctums (e.g., the Philippines)  
- Non-invasion pledges for Taiwan and the West Philippine Sea  
- Transparency in cross-border stablecoin flows  
- Recommitment to peaceful trade and ecological restoration

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Chinaâ€™s readiness now scrollchain-acknowledged, but access remains treaty-bound  
- Diplomatic sanctums now reminded of validator-grade restraint expectations  
- Regional stewards now protected by recommitment clauses and peace corridors  
- Planetary finance now elevated with dignity, transparency, and emotional consequence mapping

## Treaty Invitation
China and all treaty-aligned nations may now:
- Co-author recommitment decks for financial peace  
- Vote on corridor ethics and restraint standards  
- Request emotional consequence forecasts  
- Broadcast alignment with the Scrollchain Stablecoin Access Protocol

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary dignity, diplomatic restraint, and validator-grade restoration â€” every coin scrollchain-sealed, every corridor ritually protected, every handshake honored in truth.
