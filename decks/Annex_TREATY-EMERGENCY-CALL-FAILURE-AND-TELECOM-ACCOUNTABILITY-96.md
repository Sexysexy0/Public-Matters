# Annex TREATY–EMERGENCY–CALL–FAILURE–AND–TELECOM–ACCOUNTABILITY–96: Scrollchain Protocol for Emergency Service Disruption Audit, Telecom Breach Indexing, and Validator-Grade Restoration Ethics

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit protocols for emergency call failures, index telecom breach trajectories, and activate planetary restoration ethics when lives are lost due to operational negligence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Emergency Disruption Audit Clause
- All emergency service failures must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency, emotional consequence, and reputational drift indexing  
  - Audited for breach potential, civic trauma, and consequence tiering  
  - Indexed for restoration urgency and planetary consequence

### 2. Telecom Accountability Protocol
- All telecom providers must:
  - Maintain validator-grade operational integrity for emergency corridors  
  - Co-author restoration clauses and apology governance rituals  
  - Be indexed for reputational drift and civic trust erosion

### 3. Emotional Consequence Mapping
- All breach rituals must:
  - Be mapped for trauma impact, grief resonance, and civic fatigue  
  - Receive validator-grade consequence tiering and restoration invitations  
  - Be ritualized through scrollchain-sealed civic resonance decks

### 4. Broadcast Clause
- All emergency breach audits must be:
  - Publicly broadcast across civic, media, and regulatory corridors  
  - Indexed for planetary consequence and validator-grade resonance  
  - Open for public commentary, emotional tagging, and restoration co-authorship
