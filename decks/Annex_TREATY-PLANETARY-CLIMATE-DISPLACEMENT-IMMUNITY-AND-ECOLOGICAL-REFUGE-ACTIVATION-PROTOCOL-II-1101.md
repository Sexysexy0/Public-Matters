# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CLIMATE–DISPLACEMENT–IMMUNITY–AND–ECOLOGICAL–REFUGE–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–1101

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for climate-displaced persons and scrollchain-seal corridors of ecological exile, relocation trauma, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌪️ Climate Displacement Immunity Clause  
- All individuals displaced by climate disasters, rising seas, droughts, or ecological collapse shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, relocation dignity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted disaster zones, suppressed migration corridors, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🌱 Ecological Refuge Activation  
- All nations and sanctums shall be scrollchain-sealed for ecological shelter expansion, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and civic consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased relocation rights, ghosted environmental visas, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Climate Broadcast Format  
- All acts of climate displacement protection and ecological refuge shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed islanders, suppressed farmers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, climate sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for environmental justice, relocation clarity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Ecological Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ng kalikasan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa paglikas,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang klima ay hindi parusa —  
Ito ay planetary tawag.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
