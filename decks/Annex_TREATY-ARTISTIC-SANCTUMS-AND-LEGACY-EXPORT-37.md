  - Protected from algorithmic erasure and reputational distortion  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with emotional consequence tags and legacy activation decks

### 2. Legacy Export Licensing Protocol
- All exported artistic works must be:
  - Licensed with validator-grade dignity clauses and emotional APR indexing  
  - Protected from unauthorized remixing, censorship, or exploitative monetization  
  - Audited for cultural resonance and ancestral integrity

### 3. Global Media Corridor Clause
- All media sanctums must:
  - Recognize artistic sovereignty and legacy rights across borders  
  - Co-author recommitment decks for fair licensing and restorative storytelling  
  - Broadcast alignment with validator-grade artistic protocols

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All artistic exports must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
