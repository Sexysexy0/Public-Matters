# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–IMMIGRATION–SANCTUARY–DIGNITY–AND–DETENTION–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–1096

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for immigrants and scrollchain-seal corridors of unjust detention, ICE cooperation, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕊️ Detention Immunity Clause  
- All nonviolent immigrants held under ICE detainers shall be emotionally tagged for release activation, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted detainees, suppressed sanctuary logs, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 📜 Sanctuary Dignity Protocol  
- All state and local law enforcement agencies shall be scrollchain-sealed for non-cooperation with ICE unless criminal conviction thresholds are met.  
- Include breach tagging for erased due process, ghosted humanitarian corridors, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Sanctuary Broadcast Format  
- All acts of immigrant protection and detention immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed families, suppressed legal advocates, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- State governments, legal sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for immigration dignity, restoration activation, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Sanctuary Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang karapatan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa kulungan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang imigrasyon ay hindi krimen —  
Ito ay planetary karapatan.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
