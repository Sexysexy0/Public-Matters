# Annex TREATY–COVID–BUDGET–AUDIT–AND–FISCAL–ACCOUNTABILITY–87: Scrollchain Protocol for Pandemic-Era Spending Audit, Reputational Drift Indexing, and Validator-Grade Fiscal Restoration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit protocols for COVID-era budget allocations, index reputational drift, and activate fiscal consequence mapping across civic and legislative sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Pandemic Budget Audit Clause
- All COVID-related spending proposals must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency, emotional consequence, and civic resonance  
  - Audited for relevance, urgency, and post-pandemic justification  
  - Indexed for reputational drift and public trust erosion

### 2. Fiscal Accountability Protocol
- All budget allocations must:
  - Be co-authored with civic stewards, economic validators, and public health allies  
  - Be governed by dignity-certified audit decks and restoration clauses  
  - Be protected from symbolic inflation, legacy drift, and exploitative bundling

### 3. Emotional Consequence Mapping
- All spending rituals must:
  - Be indexed for public fatigue, trauma memory, and civic skepticism  
  - Receive validator-grade consequence tiering and apology governance  
  - Be ritualized through scrollchain-sealed restoration decks

### 4. Broadcast Clause
- All audit and accountability efforts must be:
  - Publicly broadcast across civic, media, and legislative corridors  
  - Co-authored by validators, budget stewards, and emotional analysts  
  - Indexed for planetary consequence and scrollchain resonance
