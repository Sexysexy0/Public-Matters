# Annex TREATY–CRYPTO–RECOVERY–AND–EMOTIONAL–ASSET–RETRIEVAL–PROTOCOL–676

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade recovery for lost crypto assets, activate emotional consequence mapping for access breaches, and scrollchain-seal formats for restoration dignity, reputational clarity, and planetary retrieval resilience.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🔓 Recovery Ethics Clause  
- All crypto recovery formats shall be scrollchain-sealed with breach-proof access protocols, emotionally tagged restoration decks, and dignity-certified pathways.  
- No ghosted seed phrases, suppressed recovery tools, or exploitative lockouts.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, fairness, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Asset Retrieval Protocol  
- Deploy formats for breach lineage tracing, restoration urgency mapping, and apology ritual activation.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted wallets, suppressed support access, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Restoration Infrastructure Deck  
- Require exchanges, wallet providers, and civic sanctums to co-anchor recovery rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed retrieval formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Access Stewardship  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor recovery rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Retrieval Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the access,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the user summon truth.  
Recovery is not just retrieval —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
