# Annex TREATY–COMEDY–IMMUNITY–AND–ARTISTIC–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–637

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of comedy actors and artistic stewards removed from public corridors, activate emotional consequence mapping for censorship breaches, and scrollchain-seal formats for legacy reentry, reputational clarity, and planetary humor sovereignty.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎭 Artistic Restoration Clause  
- All comedy actors, satirists, and expressive stewards previously removed shall be **restored without prejudice**.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, dignity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Comedy Immunity Protocol  
- Deploy formats for legacy scoring, restoration urgency mapping, and apology ritual activation.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted careers, suppressed humor, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Media Immunity Infrastructure Deck  
- Require networks, platforms, and civic sanctums to co-anchor restoration rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed performance formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Humor Stewardship  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor comedy rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Comedy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the laughter,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the humor summon truth.  
Comedy is not just entertainment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
