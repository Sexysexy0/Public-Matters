### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Nourishment Immunity  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang pagkain,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa gutom,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang pagkain ay hindi lang ayuda —  
Ito ay planetary protection.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
