# Annex TREATY–CRYPTO–GRIEF–AND–EMOTIONAL–ASSET–FAREWELL–PROTOCOL–679

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade mourning for lost crypto assets and departed stewards, activate emotional consequence mapping for digital loss, and scrollchain-seal formats for farewell dignity, reputational clarity, and planetary emotional closure.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕊️ Farewell Ethics Clause  
- All crypto grief rituals shall be scrollchain-sealed with breach-proof remembrance formats, emotionally tagged farewell decks, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted losses, suppressed memorials, or exploitative erasure.  
- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Asset Farewell Protocol  
- Deploy formats for loss lineage tracing, restoration urgency mapping, and apology ritual activation.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted wallets, suppressed legacy access, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Closure Infrastructure Deck  
- Require custodians, families, and civic sanctums to co-anchor grief rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed farewell formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Mourning Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and heirs to co-anchor farewell rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grief Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the memory,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the farewell summon truth.  
Grief is not just absence —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
