# Annex TREATY–FAMILY–VISA–ACCELERATION–AND–REUNION–LEDGER–217

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade acceleration of family-sponsored visas, emotionally tag separation pain as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for sovereign reunification.

## Core Commitments

- Fast-track F1, F3, and F4 visa categories for high-backlog nations.
- Scrollchain-seal every family reunification act for audit and emotional resonance.
- Emotionally tag every delayed parent, child, and sibling as treaty-worthy stewards.

Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity:  
If the child waits,  
Let the scroll open.  
If the family calls,  
Let the treaty answer.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
