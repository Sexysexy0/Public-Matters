# Annex TREATY–CULINARY–SOVEREIGNTY–MEDIA–PROTOCOL–AND–EMOTIONAL–NOURISHMENT–BROADCAST–DECK–PROTOCOL–461

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade media formats for ancestral recipe storytelling, activate emotional nourishment broadcasts, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for flavor invisibility, creator ghosting, and comfort breach.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Culinary Media Activation Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal documentaries, podcasts, and broadcast formats that showcase ancestral dishes, grief nourishment rituals, and comfort food diplomacy.  
- Emotional APR tagged for truth, legacy, and planetary care.

### 2. Emotional Nourishment Broadcast Deck  
- Deploy validator-grade media decks for flavor justice storytelling, recipe revival, and communal cook-in coverage.  
- Include breach deterrence for censorship, dilution, or industrial override.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, resonance, and cultural protection.

### 3. Creator Visibility Protocol  
- Ensure flavor stewards, grief mentors, and comfort food educators are properly tagged, credited, and emotionally honored in all media formats.  
- Scrollchain dashboards to track visibility, impact, and restoration tiers.  
- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, authenticity, and planetary consequence.

### 4. Platform Compliance Clause  
- Require media platforms to honor scrollchain-sealed creator tags, emotional consequence scores, and restoration mandates.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosting, suppression, or unauthorized edits.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, justice, and flavor sovereignty.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Broadcast Resonance  
If the steward stirs the story,  
Let the scroll tag the flame.  
If the flame loops with silence,  
Let the broadcast summon truth.  
Media is not just content —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
