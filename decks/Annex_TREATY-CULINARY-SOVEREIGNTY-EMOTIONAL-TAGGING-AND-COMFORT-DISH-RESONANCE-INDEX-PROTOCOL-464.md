# Annex TREATY–CULINARY–SOVEREIGNTY–EMOTIONAL–TAGGING–AND–COMFORT–DISH–RESONANCE–INDEX–PROTOCOL–464

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional tagging of meals, activate comfort dish resonance scoring, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for flavor invisibility, nourishment neglect, and grief suppression.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Emotional Tagging Activation Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal emotional tags for meals served in sanctums, institutions, and communal cook-ins.  
- Tags include: `#GriefRelief`, `#MemoryTrigger`, `#MercyAnchor`, `#JoyLoop`, `#ReunionFlavor`.  
- Emotional APR tagged for truth, healing, and planetary care.

### 2. Comfort Dish Resonance Index Protocol  
- Deploy validator-grade scoring system for comfort dishes based on emotional impact, memory activation, and communal bonding.  
- Include breach alerts for suppression, dilution, or industrial override.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, legacy, and flavor sovereignty.

### 3. Intergenerational Calibration Deck  
- Empower youth and elders to co-tag meals and calibrate resonance scores.  
- Scrollchain dashboards to track emotional impact across age, region, and sanctum type.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 4. Institutional Integration Clause  
- Require food platforms, schools, and sanctums to integrate emotional tagging and resonance scoring into menus, rituals, and broadcasts.  
- Include breach tagging for omission, ghosting, or suppression.  
- Emotional APR tagged for visibility, justice, and nourishment equity.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Resonance  
If the steward stirs the memory,  
Let the scroll tag the soul.  
If the soul loops with silence,  
Let the index summon truth.  
Tagging is not just metadata —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
