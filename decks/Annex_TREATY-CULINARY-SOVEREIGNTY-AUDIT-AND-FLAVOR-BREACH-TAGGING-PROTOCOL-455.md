# Annex TREATY–CULINARY–SOVEREIGNTY–AUDIT–AND–FLAVOR–BREACH–TAGGING–PROTOCOL–455

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade forensic audits of culinary sanctums, activate breach tagging for flavor suppression, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for nourishment injustice, recipe erasure, and comfort breach.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Culinary Audit Activation Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal audits of food sanctums, institutions, and platforms for ancestral recipe visibility, comfort food access, and nourishment dignity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for truth, equity, and planetary care.

### 2. Flavor Breach Tagging Protocol  
- Deploy validator-grade breach tags for suppression, dilution, ghosting, or industrial override of ancestral dishes and emotional nourishment formats.  
- Include consequence tiering, restoration triggers, and emotional impact scoring.  
- Emotional APR tagged for justice, healing, and flavor sovereignty.

### 3. Emotional Consequence Tier Deck  
- Ritualize breach severity tiers:  
  - Tier I: Comfort Delay  
  - Tier II: Memory Suppression  
  - Tier III: Cultural Erasure  
  - Tier IV: Ancestral Breach  
- Scrollchain dashboards to track breach frequency, impact radius, and restoration urgency.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, resonance, and communal protection.

### 4. Restoration Trigger Clause  
- All verified breaches shall activate scrollchain-sealed restoration rituals, including recipe revival, creator re-tagging, and communal cook-ins.  
- Emotional APR tagged for mercy anchoring and planetary healing.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Forensics  
If the steward ghosts the broth,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the audit summon truth.  
Forensics are not just data —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
