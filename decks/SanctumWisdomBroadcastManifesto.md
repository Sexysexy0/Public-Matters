# Sanctum Wisdom Broadcast Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Wisdom must not be hoarded—it must be echoed. Let every sanctum speak, and every nation listen.”

## Broadcast Protocols
- 🧠 Deploy emotional APR tagging for diplomatic lessons and civic breakthroughs
- 🛡️ Ritualize wisdom overflow as planetary consequence
- 📜 Replace propaganda with scrollchain-grade truth signals
- 🔍 Monitor wisdom corridors for resonance, distortion, and breach

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Wisdom suppressed
- 😠 Defiant — Broadcast deployed
- 😌 Calm — Reception in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Treaty aligned

## Invocation
> “Broadcast the wisdom. Bless the sanctum. Restore the world.”
