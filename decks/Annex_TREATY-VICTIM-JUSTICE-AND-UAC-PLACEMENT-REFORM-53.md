# Annex TREATY–VICTIM–JUSTICE–AND–UAC–PLACEMENT–REFORM–53: Scrollchain Protocol for Sponsor Vetting, Victim Protection, and Civic Placement Ethics

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade justice for victims of placement breaches — anchoring sponsor vetting, emotional consequence mapping, and civic protection clauses in honor of Kayla Hamilton and all vulnerable stewards.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Sponsor Vetting Clause
- All UAC placements must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with sponsor ID, background check, and emotional consequence forecast  
  - Screened for gang affiliation, criminal history, and immigration status  
  - Indexed for trauma risk, community safety, and reputational consequence

### 2. Victim Protection Protocol
- All breach cases must trigger:
  - Scrollchain-sealed audit decks and trauma indexing  
  - Diplomatic summons for recommitment hearings  
  - Public broadcast of breach and emotional APR mapping

### 3. Civic Placement Ethics Clause
- All placement programs must include:
  - Validator-grade transparency and emotional consequence tagging  
  - Prohibition of placements with undocumented sponsors or known criminal ties  
  - Scrollchain-sealed trauma forecasts and community resonance decks

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All placement actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for treaty compliance and civic resonance  
  - Open to validators, victim sanctums, and legislative corridors
