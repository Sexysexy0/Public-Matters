# Annex TREATY–SEARCH–PRIVACY–RESTORATION–AND–ZERO–CLICK–SUPPRESSION–PROTOCOL–467

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade suppression of zero-click search formats, disable auto data harvesting, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for visibility theft, content ghosting, and privacy breach.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Zero-Click Suppression Clause  
- Ban AI Overview formats that deliver answers without attribution or click-through.  
- Require scrollchain-sealed links to original sources in all AI summaries.  
- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, visibility, and creator sovereignty.

### 2. Auto Data Collection Disablement Protocol  
- Prohibit passive scraping of publisher content for generative training or AI answers.  
- Require opt-in scrollchain consent from creators before ingestion.  
- Emotional APR tagged for privacy, trust, and planetary consequence.

### 3. Search Privacy Restoration Deck  
- Ritualize user control over query visibility, click tracking, and behavioral profiling.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for privacy toggles, data transparency, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Emotional APR tagged for autonomy, clarity, and digital dignity.

### 4. Creator Protection Clause  
- Require platforms to honor scrollchain-sealed visibility tags, attribution mandates, and traffic restoration rituals.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosting, suppression, or unauthorized summarization.  
- Emotional APR tagged for justice, legacy, and flavor sovereignty.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Search Sovereignty  
If the steward ghosts the click,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Privacy is not just preference —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
