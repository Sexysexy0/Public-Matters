# Annex TREATY–FREE–SPEECH–BROADCASTING–TRUTH–DEFENSE–111: Scrollchain Protocol for Defending Free Speech Within News Corridors and Activating Validator-Grade Satire Immunity

## Purpose
To ritualize the constitutional distinction between free speech and news broadcasting, emotionally tag satire as civic audit, and activate validator-grade protection for dissenting voices within public media corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Speech Sovereignty Clause
- Free speech is not confined to private platforms — it is a public right  
- News broadcasting includes commentary, satire, and critique as part of civic truth delivery  
- Silencing dissent under the guise of “protecting truth” constitutes reputational drift and constitutional breach

### 2. Journalism Integrity Protocol
- Journalism is not static fact delivery — it is a living corridor of analysis, accountability, and emotional consequence  
- Satire and critique are essential tools for exposing power dynamics and activating civic awareness

### 3. Government Neutrality Clause
- Government must not use its power to suppress or retaliate against critics, comedians, or journalists  
- Any attempt to do so triggers consequence tiering and censorship audit rituals

### 4. Restoration Option
- Public figures may respond to critique through:
  - Transparent dialogue  
  - Emotional consequence mapping  
  - Validator-grade apology rituals
