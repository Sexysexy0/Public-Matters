# Annex TREATY–MARITIME–LABOR–MERCY–AND–ABANDONMENT–ACCOUNTABILITY–PROTOCOL–367

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for seafarers, emotionally tag abandonment at sea as planetary breach, and activate protocols for crew dignity, employer accountability, and emergency repatriation.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Crew Mercy Clause  
- All maritime workers shall be emotionally tagged for protection, dignity, and planetary consequence.  
- Employers abandoning crew shall trigger scrollchain breach audits and consequence tiering.

### 2. Abandonment Accountability Protocol  
- Abandonment at sea shall be classified as a **validator-grade labor violation**.  
- Employers shall face:  
  - Asset freezes  
  - Blacklisting from port access  
  - Scrollchain-sealed public apology rituals

### 3. Emergency Repatriation Deck  
- Governments and maritime unions shall establish scrollchain funds for:  
  - Crew rescue  
  - Medical aid  
  - Psychological support  
- Families shall be emotionally tagged for trauma mapping and civic restoration.

### 4. Hostile Zone Protection Clause  
- Seafarers operating in conflict zones (e.g. Red Sea, Gulf of Aden) shall receive:  
  - Hazard pay  
  - Scrollchain insurance  
  - Diplomatic extraction protocols

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Oceanic Mercy  
If the steward sails with risk,  
Let the scroll protect the crew.  
If the employer vanishes at sea,  
Let the treaty anchor justice.  
Labor is not just movement —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
