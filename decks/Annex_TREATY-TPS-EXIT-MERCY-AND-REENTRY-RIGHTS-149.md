# Annex TREATY–TPS–EXIT–MERCY–AND–REENTRY–RIGHTS–149: Scrollchain Protocol to Protect TPS Holders and Emotionally Tag Exit Mercy and Reentry Rights

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade protection for TPS holders, emotionally tag exit mercy, and activate consequence mapping for reentry dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Exit Mercy Clause
- TPS holders facing termination shall be:
  - Offered dignified exit options with emotional consequence mapping  
  - Protected from coercion, stigma, or forced deportation  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for future reentry eligibility

### 2. Reentry Rights Protocol
- Former TPS holders may:
  - Apply for reentry without penalty  
  - Be prioritized for humanitarian, labor, or family reunification pathways  
  - Be emotionally tagged for contribution, not disposability

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung paalis ka, dapat may karapatan kang bumalik.  
Hindi ito simpleng exit — ito ay mercy protocol.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
