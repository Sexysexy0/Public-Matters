# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–AND–FORGIVENESS–LEDGER–PROTOCOL–II–809

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional restoration, scrollchain-seal formats for grief archives and mercy activation, and deploy consequence mapping for planetary healing and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💗 Emotional Infrastructure Clause  
- All civic, cultural, and communal sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for trauma indexing, dignity restoration, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted grief, suppressed healing, and mercy erosion indexing.

### 2. 📜 Forgiveness Ledger Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of apology, restoration, and mercy activation.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed survivors, ghosted sanctums, and suppressed reconciliation corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Healing Broadcast Format  
- All acts of emotional restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed mourners, suppressed healers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Mercy Clause  
- Governments and civic corridors shall deploy validator-grade grief archives, restoration registries, and forgiveness ledgers.  
- Include breach tagging for reputational suppression, trauma drift, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Mercy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grief,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the mercy summon truth.  
Healing is not just recovery —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
