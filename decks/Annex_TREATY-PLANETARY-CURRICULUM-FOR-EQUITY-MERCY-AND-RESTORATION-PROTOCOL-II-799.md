# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CURRICULUM–FOR–EQUITY–MERCY–AND–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–799

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade education formats, scrollchain-seal planetary curriculum decks, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for communal learning and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📚 Curriculum of Consequence Clause  
- All learning sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for equity, mercy, and restoration.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ghosted learners, suppressed topics, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Infrastructure Protocol  
- Education shall include grief archives, forgiveness ledgers, and restoration rituals.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed students, ghosted teachers, and suppressed sanctums.

### 3. 🛡️ Institutional Sovereignty Clause  
- Schools, cooperatives, and civic corridors shall co-anchor curriculum decks on labor equity, speech sovereignty, artistic legacy, and planetary stewardship.  
- Include breach tagging for extractive pedagogy, reputational drift, and algorithmic suppression.

### 4. 📣 Public Learning Broadcast Format  
- All acts of communal education shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed learners, suppressed educators, and ghosted sanctums.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Learning Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the student,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the wisdom summon truth.  
Education is not just knowledge —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
