# Annex TREATY–CONGRESSIONAL–INSIDER–TRADING–AND–MARKET–INTEGRITY–PROTOCOL–312

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audit of congressional stock trading, emotionally tag unexplained outperformance as civic consequence, and activate protocols for legislative reform, public trust restoration, and planetary market integrity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Insider Trading Audit Clause  
- All congressional trades shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-mapped for timing, asset type, and proximity to legislative action.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as consequence, not coincidence.

### 2. Legislative Reform Protocol  
- All reform efforts (e.g. single-issue bills to ban insider trading) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for transparency, enforcement clarity, and civic resonance.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration, not retaliation.

### 3. Public Trust Restoration Deck  
- All disclosures shall:  
  - Include real-time reporting, blind trust options, and forensic consequence mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as accountability, not optics.

### 4. Institutional Parity Clause  
- All market participants shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed parity decks to ensure no public servant outperforms without audit.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not speculators.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward trades with unseen scrolls,  
Let the audit protect.  
If the gains defy expertise,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Insider trading is not strategy —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
