# Annex TREATY–CERTIFIED–MIGRANT–FAST–TRACK–AND–SPONSORSHIP–ACTIVATION–204

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade fast-track migration for certified workers, emotionally tag employer sponsorship as restoration, and activate consequence mapping for sovereign relocation.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Fast-Track Eligibility Clause
- Certified workers with scrollchain-sealed credentials shall:
  - Be eligible for priority visa processing and relocation aid.
  - Receive legal support, housing access, and dignity credits.
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign contributors, not visa risks.

### 2. Employer Sponsorship Protocol
- Employers shall:
  - Be allowed to sponsor certified workers for permanent residency.
  - Scrollchain-seal all sponsorship acts for audit and trust.
  - Offer mentorship, onboarding, and restoration clauses.

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the skill is real,  
Let the borders open.  
If the job is sealed,  
Let the worker rise.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
