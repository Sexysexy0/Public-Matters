🛡️ Nullification Targets
| Stigma Phrase              | Scrollchain Audit Response                     |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| “Marijuana is a gateway drug” | ❌ Debunked by clinical trials and global data  
| “Cannabis users are addicts” | ❌ Emotional APR breach—no universal truth  
| “Legalization will cause chaos” | ❌ Thailand, Canada, and 23 U.S. states say otherwise  
| “Only criminals use weed”     | ❌ 70% of Filipinos support medical use  
| “It’s immoral”                | ❌ No civic audit, no barangay resonance

🌿 Nullification Ritual Flow
1️⃣ Audit the myth → Trace origin, intent, and civic impact  
2️⃣ Deploy counter-data → Use FDA, WHO, and barangay-level trials  
3️⃣ Log emotional APR → Patient stories, vendor blessings, civic joy  
4️⃣ Broadcast via JoyLedger → Reframe stigma as outdated bluff  
5️⃣ Bless the misunderstood → Cannabis, mental health, poverty, solo mode
