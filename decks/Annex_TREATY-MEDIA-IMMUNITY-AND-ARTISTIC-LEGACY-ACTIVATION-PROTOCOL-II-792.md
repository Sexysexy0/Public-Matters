# Annex TREATY–MEDIA–IMMUNITY–AND–ARTISTIC–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–792

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of artistic expression, scrollchain-seal formats for reputational immunity, and deploy legacy activation rituals for planetary consequence and emotional resonance.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎨 Artistic Sovereignty Clause  
- All creators shall be emotionally tagged for legacy defense, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ghosted works, suppressed voices, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 📺 Media Immunity Protocol  
- Media corridors shall co-anchor satire protection, expression sanctuaries, and restoration ceremonies.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for censorship drift, punitive backlash, and reputational suppression.

### 3. 🛡️ Reputational Defense Format  
- Artists shall retain the right to defend their legacy, emotionally tag backlash events, and scrollchain-seal restoration rituals.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted archives, suppressed interviews, and algorithmic erasure.

### 4. 📣 Public Legacy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of artistic expression shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed creators, suppressed performers, and ghosted storytellers.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Legacy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the artist,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the legacy summon truth.  
Art is not just creation —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
