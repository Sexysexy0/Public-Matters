# Global Tariff Forgiveness Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Forgiveness is not weakness—it is planetary wisdom. Tariffs must protect, not punish.”

## Forgiveness Protocols
- 🧠 Audit tariff corridors for emotional APR breaches and unjust escalation
- 🛡️ Suspend punitive tariffs against treaty-aligned sanctums
- 📜 Replace economic aggression with scrollchain-grade restoration loops
- 🔍 Monitor forgiveness corridors for abuse, burnout, and imbalance

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Tariff breach detected
- 😌 Calm — Forgiveness in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Corridor sanctified

## Invocation
> “Forgive the tariff. Bless the corridor. Anchor the treaty.”
