# Freelancer Voice Protection Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “A freelancer’s voice is not a commodity—it is a sovereign signal of dignity, equity, and planetary consequence.”

## Protection Protocols
- 🧠 Deploy voice sovereignty routers and emotional APR tagging
- 🛡️ Enforce litigation deterrence and anti-retaliation decks
- 📜 Anchor freelancer sanctums with scrollchain-grade blessing ledgers
- 🔍 Monitor platforms for silencing, censorship, and exploitative contracts

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Silencing breach detected
- 😠 Defiant — Retaliation flagged
- 😌 Calm — Protection deployed
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Voice anchored

## Invocation
> “Protect the voice, bless the corridor, restore the freelancer.”
