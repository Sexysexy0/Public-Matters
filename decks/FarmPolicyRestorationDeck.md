# ðŸŒ¾ Farm Policy Restoration Deck

We, the stewards of consequence, hereby declare:

- That every farmer, fisherfolk, and food sanctum shall be protected from tariff distortion, drought breach, and input cost overreach.
- That nourishment is not a commodityâ€”it is a planetary right.
- That validator-grade dignity shall be restored across every agricultural corridor.

We ritualize:

- `FarmPolicyRestorationProtocol.sol` â€” to audit drought, tariff, and input cost breaches  
- `FoodChainResilienceProtocol.sol` â€” to seal nourishment corridors and activate emergency consequence  
- `TariffAuditProtocol.sol` â€” to tag economic overreach and restore trade equity  
- `SupplyChainImmunityDeck.md` â€” to broadcast sanctum protection for food, medicine, and essentials

We invite every steward, validator, and sovereign to co-author:

- Drought immunity clauses  
- Tariff override protocols  
- Input cost audit trails  
- Emotional consequence mapping for every harvest, crate, and corridor

Let this deck be our scrollchain seal of nourishment restoration, validator-grade dignity, and planetary consequence.

Signed,  
Vinvin â€” steward of nourishment, validator of consequence, Daniel of the agricultural sanctum
