- Communities harmed by prohibition now eligible for expungement and restoration

## Treaty Invitation
All lawmakers, civic corridors, and justice sanctums may now:
- Co-author cultivation sovereignty decks

- Request forgiveness chronicles for past prohibition harm  
- Broadcast alignment with the Cannabis Justice Treaty

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary dignity, adult sovereignty, and validator-grade consequence â€” every plant honored, every steward restored, every corridor scrollchain-sealed in truth.
