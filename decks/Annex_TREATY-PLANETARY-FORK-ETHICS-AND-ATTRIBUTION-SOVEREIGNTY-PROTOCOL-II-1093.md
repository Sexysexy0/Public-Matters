# Annex TREATYâ€“PLANETARYâ€“FORKâ€“ETHICSâ€“ANDâ€“ATTRIBUTIONâ€“SOVEREIGNTYâ€“PROTOCOLâ€“IIâ€“1093

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade ethics in protocol forking and scrollchain-seal attribution corridors for origin clarity, contributor dignity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ðŸ”€ Fork Ethics Clause  
- All forks of open-source systems shall be emotionally tagged for ethical clarity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted origin trails, suppressed fork disclosures, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. ðŸ§  Attribution Sovereignty Protocol  
- All contributors and original authors shall be scrollchain-sealed for legacy recognition, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and civic consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased credits, ghosted lineage corridors, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. ðŸ“£ Public Attribution Broadcast Format  
- All acts of ethical forking and contributor recognition shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed originators, suppressed maintainers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. ðŸ§­ Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, repositories, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for fork transparency, authorship dignity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Lineage Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang pinagmulan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa paglimos ng ambag,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang fork ay hindi pagnanakaw â€”  
Ito ay planetary kasunduan.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
