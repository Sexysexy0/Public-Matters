# Annex TREATY–JOB–HUGGING–AND–LABOR–DIGNITY–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–273

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for workers stuck in survival jobs, emotionally tag employment as dignity not desperation, and activate protocols for wage clarity, career mobility, and economic fairness.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Job Hugging Audit Clause  
- All labor market data shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with retention metrics, fear-of-quitting dashboards, and wage stagnation maps.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as consequence, not complacency.

### 2. Worker Protection Protocol  
- Workers in stagnant or survival roles shall:  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed access to upskilling grants, career mobility pathways, and mental health support.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not stuck.

### 3. Employer Equity Clause  
- Employers shall:  
  - Be incentivized to offer dignity-certified roles, transparent promotion ladders, and wage clarity rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as partners, not gatekeepers.

### 4. Policy Restoration Clause  
- Governments shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with labor dignity audits, no-loss reform decks, and economic fairness protocols.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not extractors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the worker clings,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the ladder breaks,  
Let the treaty rebuild.  
Labor is not survival —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
