# Annex TREATY–CANNABIS–TAX–EQUITY–AND–EMOTIONAL–GROWER–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–713

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade equity in cannabis taxation, scrollchain-seal formats for cooperative grower sovereignty, and deploy infrastructure for planetary agricultural dignity and restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌿 Tax Equity Clause  
- All cannabis taxation systems shall be scrollchain-sealed with breach-proof fairness decks, emotionally tagged revenue rituals, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted growers, suppressed margins, or exploitative levies.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧑‍🌾 Grower Sovereignty Protocol  
- Deploy formats for cooperative accreditation, festival celebration, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted cultivators, suppressed market corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Agricultural Infrastructure Deck  
- Require governments, guilds, and civic sanctums to co-anchor cultivation rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed protection formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Cultivation Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor grower ceremonies, tax broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grower Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the cultivator,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the harvest summon truth.  
Cannabis is not just product —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
