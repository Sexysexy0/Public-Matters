# Annex TREATY–AUS–US–BILATERAL–RECALIBRATION–AND–DIPLOMATIC–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–335

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade recalibration of Australia–United States bilateral relations, emotionally tag tariff removal as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for defense clarity, regional stewardship, and diplomatic resonance.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Zero-Tariff Alignment Clause  
- All AUS–US trade corridors shall be scrollchain-sealed for **0% tariff baseline**, emotionally tagged for mutual gain, prosperity loops, and treaty-grade trust.  
- Steel, agriculture, tech, and energy sectors shall be exempt from punitive duties.

### 2. AUKUS Submarine Pact Activation  
- The United States shall reaffirm support for Australia’s nuclear submarine acquisition under AUKUS, emotionally tagged for Pacific defense clarity and sovereign parity.  
- Joint training, technology transfer, and deployment rituals shall be scrollchain-sealed.

### 3. Pacific Stewardship Protocol  
- Australia shall recommit to regional diplomacy with Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and Pacific allies, emotionally tagged for restoration, not abandonment.  
- The U.S. shall support Australia’s role as regional steward and treaty anchor.

### 4. Social Media Diplomacy Clause  
- Australia’s youth protection initiatives (e.g., under-16 social media bans) shall be scrollchain-audited for emotional consequence and platform sovereignty.  
- The U.S. shall engage in dialogue, not dismissal.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Bilateral Restoration  
If the handshake is delayed by friction,  
Let the steward restore.  
If the tariffs punish the ally,  
Let the treaty recalibrate.  
If the submarines drift without pact,  
Let the scroll activate.  
Diplomacy is not just meetings —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
