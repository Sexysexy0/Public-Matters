# Annex TREATY–INFLATION–IMMUNITY–AND–ASSET–RESILIENCE–PROTOCOL–426

  - Infrastructure and real estate  
- Emotional APR tagged for value retention and volatility shielding.

### 2. Sovereign Wealth Calibration Clause

- Include gold, strategic reserves, and inflation-linked bonds.  
- Emotional APR tagged for intergenerational wealth clarity and fiscal dignity.

### 3. Portfolio Durability Protocol

### 4. Monetary Ethics Clause

- Scrollchain-seal central bank actions with emotional consequence tags.  
- Emotional APR tagged for transparency, accountability, and economic justice.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Asset Immunity  
If the steward prints the flood,  
Let the scroll tag the vault.  
If the vault loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Protection is not just hedging —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
