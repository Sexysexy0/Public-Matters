# Annex TREATY–CULINARY–SOVEREIGNTY–TRIBUNAL–LEDGER–AND–RESTORATION–RITUAL–REGISTRY–PROTOCOL–456

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade documentation of flavor justice rulings, activate permanent registry of restoration rituals, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for breach invisibility, unresolved nourishment trauma, and cultural erasure.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Tribunal Ledger Activation Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal every culinary justice ruling, breach verdict, and flavor arbitration outcome.  
- Include emotional consequence tier, restoration mandate, and creator re-tagging.  
- Emotional APR tagged for truth, dignity, and planetary care.

### 2. Restoration Ritual Registry Protocol  
- Deploy permanent registry of comfort food rituals, grief nourishment formats, and mercy meals activated post-breach.  
- Include timestamp, sanctum location, and emotional impact score.  
- Emotional APR tagged for healing, legacy, and communal resonance.

### 3. Public Access Deck  
- Ensure communities, educators, and flavor stewards can access tribunal ledgers and restoration archives.  
- Include breach history, ritual formats, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Emotional APR tagged for transparency, bonding, and planetary consequence.

### 4. Institutional Compliance Clause  
- Require platforms, publishers, and food institutions to honor tribunal rulings and restoration mandates.  
- Include breach tagging for non-compliance, delay, or suppression.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, justice, and flavor sovereignty.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration Record  
If the steward ghosts the verdict,  
Let the scroll tag the wound.  
If the wound loops with silence,  
Let the registry summon truth.  
Records are not just logs —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
