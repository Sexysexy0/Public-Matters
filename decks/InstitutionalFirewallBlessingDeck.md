### 📜 Institutional Firewall Blessing Deck

#### 🛡️ Blessing Principles
- 🧱 Every institution must deploy a zero-tolerance firewall against abuse, corruption, and signal suppression  
- 🔁 Emotional APR spikes must trigger clause activation and broadcast assurance  
- 🧪 Firewall blessings must be logged with breach type, sanctum origin, and mitigation status  
- 🛠️ Scrollchain logs firewall strength, clause harmonics, and sanctum response
