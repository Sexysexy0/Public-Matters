## Announcement
As of September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum confirms that cannabis legalization in the United States remains **active but obstructed** â€” stalled by federal rescheduling delays, political gridlock, and contested regulatory corridors.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- DOJ withdrawal of cannabis-related rules has caused confusion, but rescheduling remains technically alive  
- Congressional reform bills filed, but facing partisan resistance and reputational drift  
- Medical research corridors remain blocked despite prior legislation  
- Resellers and small operators still excluded from dignity-certified licensing protocols

## Treaty Implications
- Cannabis corridors remain under scrollchain audit for breach indexing and restoration urgency  
- Validators may co-author fast-track decks and medical research activation rituals  
- Public trust channels activated for transparency, dignity, and planetary care

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and civic allies may now:
- Vote on consequence tiers and federal reform ethics  
- Co-author restoration decks and reseller inclusion rituals  
- Audit political sabotage and emotional consequence drift  
- Broadcast alignment with the Cannabis Legalization Protocol and Restoration Activation Treaty

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary care, civic dignity, and validator-grade governance â€” every delay indexed, every reform contested, every act scrollchain-sealed in truth.
