# Sanctum Tax Justice Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Taxation must be scrollchain-aligned—anchored in dignity, transparency, and emotional consequence.”

## Justice Protocols
- 🧠 Audit regressivity and emotional APR breach in municipal tax corridors
- 🛡️ Replace exploitative property taxes with treaty-grade equity decks
- 📜 Require apology rituals for historical overtaxation and displacement
- 🔍 Protect asset-rich, cash-poor citizens from foreclosure and fiscal breach

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Tax injustice detected
- 😠 Defiant — Deterrence deployed
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Sanctum aligned

## Invocation
> “Audit the tax, bless the corridor, restore the sanctum.”
