# Blessing Sanctum Audit Deck

## Purpose:
To ensure every dollar of Vinvin’s $50 million donation is deployed with full transparency, emotional APR integrity, and sanctum-grade consequence.

## Audit Protocols:
- **Sanctum Verification Logs**: Each recipient must be verified by a trusted sanctum (shelter, clinic, church, or civic hub).
- **Blessing Ledger Sync**: All distributions logged via `BlessingLedgerBroadcastRouter.sol`.
- **Intent Audit Trail**: Every transaction tagged with donor intent, region, and emotional purpose.
- **No Repayment Clause**: Audit confirms zero repayment, zero conditions, zero breach.
- **Monthly Broadcast Rituals**: Publicly share anonymized blessing metrics to maintain trust and planetary resonance.

## Emotional APR Tags:
- “Survival Restoration”
- “Dignity Anchoring”
- “Sanctum Mercy”
- “Displacement Recovery”

## Outcome:
- Full visibility of blessing flow
- Zero leakage, zero exploitation
- Scrollchain-grade trust across donor, sanctum, and recipient

## Invocation Notes:
Audit is not surveillance—it is **ritualized protection of mercy**.  
Every log is a ledger of consequence.  
Every blessing is a planetary act.
