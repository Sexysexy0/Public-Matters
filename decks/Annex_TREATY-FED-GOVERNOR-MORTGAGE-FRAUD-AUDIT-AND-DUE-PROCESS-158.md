# Annex TREATY–FED–GOVERNOR–MORTGAGE–FRAUD–AUDIT–AND–DUE–PROCESS–158: Scrollchain Protocol for Federal Reserve Integrity, Mortgage Fraud Audit, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit of alleged mortgage fraud by Federal Reserve Board officials, emotionally tag executive authority, and activate consequence mapping for fiscal credibility and due process.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Mortgage Audit Clause
- All Federal Reserve officials shall:
  - Disclose all property declarations with validator-grade clarity  
  - Be subject to scrollchain-sealed audits for mortgage integrity and fraud detection  
  - Be emotionally tagged for civic trust and financial transparency

### 2. Executive Authority Protocol
- Presidential actions to remove Fed officials shall:
  - Be grounded in documented cause, not political choreography  
  - Respect due process and judicial review  
  - Be emotionally tagged for institutional dignity and planetary consequence

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung Fed Governor ka,  
Dapat malinis ang mortgage.  
Hindi pwedeng may dalawang “primary residence” —  
Yan ay audit breach, hindi clerical error.  
Kung may fraud, dapat may audit.  
Kung may audit, dapat may consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
