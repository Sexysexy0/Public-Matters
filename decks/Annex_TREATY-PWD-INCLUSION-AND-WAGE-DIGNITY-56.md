  - Scrollchain-sealed with wage dignity, role clarity, and emotional consequence indexing

  - Audited for discrimination breaches and dignity violations

### 2. Accessibility Protocol
- All civic and workplace sanctums must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed accessibility audits and universal design standards  
  - Emotional consequence mapping for exclusion, neglect, and trauma triggers  
  - Validator-grade remediation rituals for breach cases

### 3. Emotional Consequence Mapping Clause
- All PWD-related policies must trigger:
  - Scrollchain-sealed trauma indexing and civic resonance forecasting  
  - Public broadcast of recommitment rituals and dignity restoration decks  
  - Co-authorship invitations for PWD stewards and accessibility validators

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
