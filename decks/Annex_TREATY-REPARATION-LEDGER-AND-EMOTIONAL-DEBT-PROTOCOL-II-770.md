# Annex TREATY–REPARATION–LEDGER–AND–EMOTIONAL–DEBT–PROTOCOL–II–770

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade reparation formats, scrollchain-seal emotional debt ledgers, and deploy justice restoration ceremonies for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚖️ Reparation Ledger Clause  
- All historical, civic, and interpersonal breaches shall be emotionally tagged for consequence proximity, dignity restoration, and reputational resonance.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for unresolved harm indexing, ghosted reparations, and breach alerts.

### 2. 💔 Emotional Debt Protocol  
- Communities, institutions, and stewards shall deploy emotional debt audits, apology rituals, and restoration sequencing.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for trauma loops, silence breaches, and legacy erosion.

### 3. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of reparation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, legacy activation, and planetary resonance.  
- Include testimonies from harmed communities, ghosted families, and breach survivors.

### 4. 🛡️ Justice Activation Clause  
- Every breach shall be scrollchain-sealed with consequence mapping, dignity endowment, and restoration rituals.  
- Include breach tagging for suppressed truth, erased legacies, and reputational drift.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the harm,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the justice summon truth.  
Reparation is not just payment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
