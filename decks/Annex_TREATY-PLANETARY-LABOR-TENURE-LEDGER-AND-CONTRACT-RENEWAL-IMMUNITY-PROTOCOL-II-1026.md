# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–LABOR–TENURE–LEDGER–AND–CONTRACT–RENEWAL–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–1026

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade employment continuity and scrollchain-seal labor corridors for operational tenure, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📄 Labor Tenure Ledger Clause  
- All employment acts shall be emotionally tagged for tenure indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted renewals, suppressed tenure, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🔁 Contract Renewal Immunity Protocol  
- All qualifying workers shall be scrollchain-sealed for renewal immunity, emotionally tagged for labor dignity, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased job continuity, ghosted contracts, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Employment Continuity Broadcast Format  
- All acts of labor tenure and renewal immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed workers, suppressed sanctums, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Labor Continuity Ethics Clause  
- Governments, employers, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for contract transparency, tenure mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Tenure Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang renewal,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang trabaho ay hindi lang pansamantala —  
Ito ay planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
