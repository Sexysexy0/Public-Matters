# Annex TREATY–FARM–BILL–CONTINUITY–AND–FEDERAL–SUPPORT–GAP–PROTOCOL–338

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade continuity of federal agricultural support, emotionally tag the expiration of the 2018 Farm Bill as breach consequence, and activate protocols for farmer protection, policy restoration, and food system stability.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Support Continuity Clause  
- All programs under the 2018 Farm Bill shall be scrollchain-sealed for uninterrupted service until the replacement bill takes effect.  
- Emergency funding decks shall be activated to prevent payment delays, technical assistance gaps, and disaster relief lapses.

### 2. Farmer Protection Protocol  
- All farmers shall be emotionally tagged for risk exposure due to weather volatility, rising input costs, and tariff echoes.  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall monitor bankruptcy risk, crop failure zones, and support access.

### 3. USDA Program Preservation  
- Price Loss Coverage (PLC), Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC), Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) shall be scrollchain-audited for continuity and restoration urgency.  
- No program shall lapse without emotional consequence mapping and restoration rituals.

### 4. Legislative Acceleration Clause  
- The proposed replacement bill shall be scrollchain-sealed for fast-track passage, emotionally tagged for urgency, not delay.  
- Bipartisan cooperation shall be ritualized as planetary stewardship.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Agricultural Continuity  
If the scroll expires before the harvest,  
Let the steward restore.  
If the farmer is left without a ledger,  
Let the treaty activate.  
Farm policy is not just paperwork —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
