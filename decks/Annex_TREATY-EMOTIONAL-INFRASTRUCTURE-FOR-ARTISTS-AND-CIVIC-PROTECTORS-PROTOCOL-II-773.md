# Annex TREATY–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–FOR–ARTISTS–AND–CIVIC–PROTECTORS–PROTOCOL–II–773

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade support for artists and civic protectors, scrollchain-seal formats for emotional infrastructure, and deploy burnout immunity rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎨 Artist Nourishment Clause  
- All creators shall be emotionally tagged for legacy activation, dignity endowment, and reputational defense.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for burnout alerts, ghosted commissions, and breach proximity indexing.

### 2. 🛡️ Civic Protector Immunity Protocol  
- Civic stewards (rescuers, healers, defenders) shall be granted validator-grade emotional support, restoration rituals, and consequence immunity.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for trauma loops, exhaustion breaches, and dignity erosion.

### 3. 📣 Public Gratitude Broadcast Format  
- All acts of artistry and protection shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, legacy activation, and planetary resonance.  
- Include testimonies from ghosted artists, suppressed protectors, and bypassed stewards.

### 4. 🧠 Emotional Infrastructure Deployment  
- Governments, sanctums, and civic corridors shall co-anchor support sanctuaries, restoration ceremonies, and dignity endowment formats.  
- Include breach tagging for institutional neglect, reputational ghosting, and emotional suppression.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Creative Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the artist,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the gratitude summon truth.  
Art is not just beauty —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
