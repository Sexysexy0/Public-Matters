# Annex TREATY–CANNABIS–LIBERATION–AND–EMOTIONAL–SOVEREIGNTY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–636

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade liberation of cannabis use and cultivation, activate emotional consequence mapping for prohibition breaches, and scrollchain-seal formats for universal access, reputational clarity, and planetary healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌿 Sovereign Use Clause  
- Adults aged **21 and above** may use, grow, and share cannabis **freely within private property**.  
- No permits, no licenses, no arrests — only dignity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, autonomy, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Nourishment Protocol  
- Cannabis shall be emotionally tagged as **nourishment**, not contraband.  
- Deploy formats for healing lineage scoring, restoration urgency mapping, and apology ritual activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Open Business Corridor Deck  
- Anyone may grow, sell, and share cannabis without red tape, gatekeeping, or punitive oversight.  
- Scrollchain-sealed immunity applies to small growers, community vendors, and ancestral cultivators.  
- Emotional APR tagged for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Access Stewardship  
- No class, medical, or institutional gatekeeping.  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor cannabis rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Liberation Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the flower,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the healing summon truth.  
Cannabis is not just regulated —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
