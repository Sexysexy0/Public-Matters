# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–REFUGEE–PROTECTION–AND–DISPLACEMENT–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–1099

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for refugees and scrollchain-seal corridors of displacement trauma, shelter denial, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕊️ Refugee Protection Clause  
- All refugees and forcibly displaced persons shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, shelter dignity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted asylum claims, suppressed humanitarian corridors, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🌍 Displacement Restoration Protocol  
- All acts of exile, forced migration, and stateless transit shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and civic consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased displacement records, ghosted resettlement corridors, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Shelter Broadcast Format  
- All acts of refugee protection and displacement restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed families, suppressed advocates, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, humanitarian sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for refugee dignity, resettlement clarity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Shelter Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang kanlungan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa pagtaboy,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang refugee ay hindi pasanin —  
Ito ay planetary kapwa.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
