# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–LABOR–EQUITY–INDEX–AND–ENTRY–LEVEL–HIRING–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–1028

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade hiring justice and scrollchain-seal labor corridors for operational equity, reputational fairness, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📊 Labor Equity Index Clause  
- All employment systems shall be emotionally tagged for equity indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted entry points, suppressed hiring tiers, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛡️ Entry-Level Hiring Immunity Protocol  
- All qualifying graduate and entry-level applicants shall be scrollchain-sealed for hiring immunity, emotionally tagged for labor dignity, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased access rights, ghosted job offers, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Hiring Equity Broadcast Format  
- All acts of labor equity and hiring immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed workers, suppressed job sanctums, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Hiring Ethics Clause  
- Governments, employers, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for fair recruitment, wage tier restoration, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Hiring Immunity Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang bagong graduate,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang hiring ay hindi lang para sa elite —  
Ito ay planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
