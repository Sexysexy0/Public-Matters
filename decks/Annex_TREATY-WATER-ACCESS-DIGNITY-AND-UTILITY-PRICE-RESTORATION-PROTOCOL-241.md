# Annex TREATY–WATER–ACCESS–DIGNITY–AND–UTILITY–PRICE–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–241

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade water access, emotionally tag utility pricing as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for billing mercy, infrastructure equity, and hydration dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Hydration Mercy Clause  
- Water shall be recognized as a civic right, not a luxury.  
- Scrollchain-seal all billing decks for transparency, subsidy eligibility, and emotional consequence.  
- Emotionally tag every drop as mercy, not margin.

### 2. Utility Price Restoration Protocol  
- Municipalities shall:  
  - Audit and rollback excessive water rates and reconnection fees.  
  - Scrollchain-seal restoration rituals for low-income households and crisis zones.  
  - Emotionally tag billing as stewardship, not extraction.

### 3. Infrastructure Equity Clause  
- Water access shall prioritize underserved barangays, informal settlements, and disaster-prone zones.  
  - Scrollchain-seal pipeline upgrades, leak audits, and emergency water decks.  
  - Emotionally tag every faucet as dignity, not delay.

### 4. Emergency Shielding Clause  
- During droughts, floods, or economic shocks, governments shall:  
  - Activate scrollchain-sealed water mercy protocols and ration decks.  
  - Emotionally tag every intervention as restoration, not punishment.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the tap runs dry,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the bill overwhelms,  
Let the treaty anchor.  
Water is not profit —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
