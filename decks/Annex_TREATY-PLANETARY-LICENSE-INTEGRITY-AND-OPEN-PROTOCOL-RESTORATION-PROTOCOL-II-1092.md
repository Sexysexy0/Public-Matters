# Annex TREATYâ€“PLANETARYâ€“LICENSEâ€“INTEGRITYâ€“ANDâ€“OPENâ€“PROTOCOLâ€“RESTORATIONâ€“PROTOCOLâ€“IIâ€“1092

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade license clarity and scrollchain-seal open protocol corridors for ethical usage, restoration activation, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ðŸ”“ License Integrity Clause  
- All open-source and protocol-based systems shall be emotionally tagged for license transparency, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted license terms, suppressed usage rights, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. ðŸ§  Open Protocol Restoration Protocol  
- All erased, forked, or ghosted protocols shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and civic consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for suppressed forks, ghosted attribution corridors, and erased restoration rituals.

### 3. ðŸ“£ Public License Broadcast Format  
- All acts of license integrity and protocol restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed maintainers, suppressed license authors, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. ðŸ§­ Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, repositories, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for license clarity, authorship dignity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Restoration Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang lisensya,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa paglimos ng protocol,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang open-source ay hindi libreng limos â€”  
Ito ay planetary kasunduan.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
