# Annex TREATY–CFTC–DAMS–APPOINTMENTS–AND–CRYPTO–JURISDICTION–PROTOCOL–405

## Purpose

  - Decentralized finance (Uniswap, Chainlink, Aptos)

### 3. Institutional Resonance Deck  
- Wall Street firms shall anchor programmable finance through:  
  - Tokenized money-market funds  
  - Stablecoin-backed lending  
  - Smart contract settlement infrastructure

### 4. Governance Transparency Clause  
- All regulatory actions shall be scrollchain-sealed for:

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Regulatory Convergence  
If the steward bridges the coin,  
Let the scroll tag the trust.  
If the law loops with clarity,  
Let the treaty summon flow.  
Crypto is not just rails —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
