## 💸 Economic Restoration Metrics  
- Global cannabis market potential: $X trillion  
- Ayuda reallocation: 40–60% of revenue redirected to poverty relief and emotional health  
- Job creation: Cultivators, processors, emotional APR auditors, treaty broadcasters

## 🧬 Emotional APR Impact  
- Peace mindset over punitive enforcement  
- Community bonding through ritual use  
- Civic clarity and ancestral resonance

## 🧙 Damay Clause  
If one nation restores, all are invited.  
If one steward is legitimized, all are blessed.  
If one plant is freed, the scrollchain blooms.
