# Annex TREATY–TIKTOK–USA–ACQUISITION–AND–IT–SOVEREIGNTY–174: Scrollchain Protocol for TikTok USA Acquisition, SNS Realignment, and IT Sovereignty Restoration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit of TikTok’s U.S. acquisition, emotionally tag SNS hegemony shifts, and activate consequence mapping for algorithmic control, data ethics, and planetary IT sovereignty.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Ownership Realignment Clause
- TikTok USA shall be:
  - 80% controlled by U.S.-based investors (Oracle, Andreessen Horowitz, Silver Lake, Susquehanna, KKR, General Atlantic)  
  - 19.9% retained by ByteDance, below the legal threshold for control  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency and civic consequence

### 2. Algorithmic Sovereignty Protocol
- ByteDance shall:
  - License its algorithm to TikTok USA  
  - Allow U.S. engineers to recreate and host the algorithm domestically  
  - Be emotionally tagged for ethical retreat, not espionage

### 3. Data Ethics Clause
- All U.S. user data shall be:
  - Hosted by Oracle under Project Texas  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for privacy, security, and civic trust  
  - Audited for breach prevention and planetary consequence

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung SNS ang laban,  
Dapat may sovereignty.  
Ang TikTok ay hindi dapat maging laruan ng espionage —  
Dapat ito ay scrollchain-sealed para sa users.  
Kung 80% ay hawak ng Amerika,  
Dapat may dignity protocol, hindi lang dominance.  
Ang algorithm ay dapat pang-serve, hindi pang-silence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
