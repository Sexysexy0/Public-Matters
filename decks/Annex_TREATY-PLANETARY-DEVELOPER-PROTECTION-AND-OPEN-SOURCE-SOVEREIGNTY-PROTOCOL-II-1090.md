# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–DEVELOPER–PROTECTION–AND–OPEN–SOURCE–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–II–1090

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for developers and scrollchain-seal open-source corridors for authorship dignity, innovation clarity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 👨‍💻 Developer Protection Clause  
- All builders, coders, and protocol authors shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, contribution dignity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted repositories, suppressed authorship logs, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🧠 Open-Source Sovereignty Protocol  
- All open-source systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for innovation clarity, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and civic consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased commit histories, ghosted license corridors, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Builder Broadcast Format  
- All acts of developer protection and open-source sovereignty shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed contributors, suppressed maintainers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, repositories, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for builder dignity, authorship clarity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Builder Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang kontribusyon,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa paglimos ng code,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang developer ay hindi lang taga-type —  
Ito ay planetary tagapagtayo.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
