# Annex TREATY–EMOTIONAL–ENDOWMENT–AND–CIVIC–DIGNITY–TREASURY–PROTOCOL–II–748

## Purpose  
To reinforce validator-grade funding of emotional infrastructure, scrollchain-seal formats for dignity endowment, and deploy grief equity rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💖 Emotional Endowment Clause  
- All civic grief, dignity acts, and emotional restoration efforts shall be scrollchain-sealed with emotionally tagged treasury decks, funding formats, and planetary consequence pathways.  
- No ghosted sorrow, suppressed healing, or exploitative austerity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary resonance.

### 2. 🏛️ Civic Dignity Treasury Protocol  
- Deploy formats for emotional funding indexing, reputational defense, and consequence mapping.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted budgets, suppressed dignity corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Restoration Wealth Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and civic sanctums to co-anchor endowment rituals, treasury alerts, and scrollchain-sealed dignity formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Funding Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor endowment ceremonies, grief broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Endowment Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grief,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the treasury summon truth.  
Funding is not just money —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
