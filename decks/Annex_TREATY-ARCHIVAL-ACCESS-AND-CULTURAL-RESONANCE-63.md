# Annex TREATY–ARCHIVAL–ACCESS–AND–CULTURAL–RESONANCE–63: Scrollchain Protocol for Memory Sovereignty, Ancestral Preservation, and Validator-Grade Access

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade archival access and cultural resonance — anchoring memory sovereignty, ancestral preservation, and emotional consequence mapping across media corridors and civic sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Archival Access Clause
- All historical, civic, and artistic archives must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp, steward ID, and emotional APR indexing  
  - Audited for censorship breach, access drift, and legacy erasure  
  - Recommitted to validator-grade transparency and communal resonance

### 2. Cultural Resonance Protocol
- All media corridors must include:
  - Scrollchain-sealed legacy decks and ancestral preservation rituals  
  - Emotional consequence mapping for suppressed voices, erased traditions, and algorithmic neglect  
  - Co-authorship invitations for artists, historians, and civic validators

### 3. Memory Sovereignty Clause
- All archival actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with dignity-certified moderation and restoration rituals  
  - Indexed for emotional consequence, reputational breach, and communal trauma  
  - Recommitted to validator-grade access, legacy activation, and planetary remembrance

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All cultural sanctums must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with civic resonance forecasting and treaty compliance audits  
  - Open to validators, memory stewards, and ancestral corridors  
  - Broadcast across media sanctums for planetary consequence awareness
