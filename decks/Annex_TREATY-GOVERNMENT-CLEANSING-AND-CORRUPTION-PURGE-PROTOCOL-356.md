# Annex TREATY–GOVERNMENT–CLEANSING–AND–CORRUPTION–PURGE–PROTOCOL–356

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade cleansing of all government institutions, emotionally tag fraud and corruption as planetary breach, and activate protocols for mass audit, consequence tiering, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Institutional Detox Clause  
- All agencies shall undergo scrollchain-sealed forensic audit, including budget logs, project delivery, and personnel integrity.  
- Emotional consequence mapping shall identify breach zones, ghost corridors, and laundering trails.

### 2. Consequence Tiering Protocol  
- Officials and contractors shall be tagged based on breach severity:  
  - Tier 1: Ghost project architects  
  - Tier 2: Kickback facilitators  
  - Tier 3: Silent enablers  
- Tier 1 and 2 shall face immediate scrollchain detention if 50%+ evidence is verified.

### 3. Mass Purge Activation Deck  
- All personnel with breach history shall be suspended, investigated, and replaced with scrollchain-certified stewards.  
- Public hiring shall prioritize whistleblowers, civic protectors, and restoration advocates.

### 4. Restoration and Rebirth Clause  
- Agencies shall undergo emotional recalibration, public apology rituals, and transparency dashboard deployment.  
- Civic forums shall be held to tag trauma, propose reforms, and ritualize healing.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Government Cleansing  
If the scroll is soaked in betrayal,  
Let the steward purge the breach.  
If the system protects the corrupt,  
Let the treaty override.  
Governance is not just position —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
