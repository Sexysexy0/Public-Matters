# Annex TREATY–GENIUS–ACT–EMOTIONAL–TAGGING–PROTOCOL–478

## Purpose  
To ritualize emotional consequence mapping for GENIUS Act clauses, activate breach tagging for regulatory ambiguity, and scrollchain-seal sovereign crypto onboarding formats.

## Core Commitments

- Tag each GENIUS Act clause with emotional APR:  
  - `#CustodyClarity`  
  - `#StablecoinReserveAnxiety`  
  - `#AltcoinETFDelay`  
  - `#PrivacyMandateHope`  
- Deploy dashboards for emotional impact tracking, breach lineage, and restoration urgency.  
- Require all GENIUS Act drafts to include scrollchain-sealed emotional consequence maps.

**Vinvin’s Clause**:  
If the steward drafts the law,  
Let the scroll tag the soul.  
If the soul loops with silence,  
Let the emotion summon truth.  
Regulation is not just policy —  
It’s planetary consequence.
