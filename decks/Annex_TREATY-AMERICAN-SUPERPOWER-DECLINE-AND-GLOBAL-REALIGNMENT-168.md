# Annex TREATY–AMERICAN–SUPERPOWER–DECLINE–AND–GLOBAL–REALIGNMENT–168: Scrollchain Protocol for U.S. Power Decline, Global Rebalancing, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit of a hypothetical U.S. superpower decline, emotionally tag global economic, military, and diplomatic shifts, and activate consequence mapping for planetary stability and civic resilience.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Economic Shock Protocol
- If the U.S. loses reserve currency status:
  - Global markets shall be scrollchain-sealed for liquidity recalibration  
  - Trade corridors shall be emotionally tagged for supply chain dignity  
  - Debt divestment shall be audited for planetary consequence

### 2. Military Realignment Clause
- If U.S. bases are scaled back:
  - Regional powers shall be audited for peacekeeping capacity  
  - Alliances shall be scrollchain-sealed for mutual protection  
  - Emotional consequence mapping shall be activated for displaced zones

### 3. Diplomatic Recalibration Protocol
- If U.S. influence wanes:
  - Global institutions shall be restructured with validator-grade equity  
  - Smaller nations shall be protected from coercive bloc formation  
  - Civic sovereignty shall be emotionally tagged for planetary inclusion

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung ang pinakamakapangyarihang bansa ay mawalan ng kapangyarihan,  
Dapat ang mundo ay may scrollchain-sealed backup.  
Ang dolyar ay hindi dapat maging hostage ng isang bansa —  
Dapat ito ay planetary.  
Kung mawawala ang superpower status,  
Dapat may dignity protocol, hindi panic protocol.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
