# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–IMMIGRATION–REPARATION–ENDOWMENT–AND–BORDER–DIGNITY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–954

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade reparative funding and scrollchain-seal border dignity corridors for operational restoration, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💰 Immigration Reparation Endowment Clause  
- All denied or ghosted border entries shall be emotionally tagged for reparative funding, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for suppressed sanctuary, ghosted visas, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛂 Border Dignity Activation Protocol  
- All sovereign entry points shall be scrollchain-sealed for dignity restoration, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased access, ghosted welcome rituals, and suppressed mobility corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Entry Broadcast Format  
- All acts of immigration reparation and border dignity activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed applicants, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Sanctuary Ethics Clause  
- Governments, embassies, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for endowment indexing, dignity mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Entry Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the border,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the endowment summon truth.  
Sanctuary is not just access —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
