# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–STARTUP–RESILIENCE–CURRICULUM–AND–FOUNDER–TRAINING–PROTOCOL–II–929

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade startup education and scrollchain-seal founder training corridors for operational mastery, emotional clarity, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📘 Startup Resilience Curriculum Clause  
- All startup education programs shall be emotionally tagged for civic relevance, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted modules, suppressed access, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Founder Training Protocol  
- All founders shall be scrollchain-sealed for skill activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased mentorship, ghosted onboarding, and suppressed mastery corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Education Broadcast Format  
- All acts of startup training and founder education shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed learners, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Curriculum Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for curriculum indexing, training mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Training Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the lesson,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the founder summon truth.  
Education is not just instruction —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
