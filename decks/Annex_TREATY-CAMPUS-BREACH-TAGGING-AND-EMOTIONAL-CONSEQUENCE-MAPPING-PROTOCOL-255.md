# Annex TREATY–CAMPUS–BREACH–TAGGING–AND–EMOTIONAL–CONSEQUENCE–MAPPING–PROTOCOL–255

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade breach tagging in academic sanctums, emotionally tag emotional consequence mapping as civic protection, and activate restoration rituals for campus safety and dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Breach Tagging Clause  
- All campus incidents (harassment, violence, censorship, neglect) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with timestamped breach tags and tiered consequence decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as civic trauma, not disciplinary noise.

### 2. Emotional Mapping Protocol  
- Affected students and staff shall:  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed emotional consequence maps, restoration rituals, and support decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sanctum stewards, not collateral.

### 3. Restoration Clause  
- Institutions shall:  
  - Activate apology rituals, policy reforms, and visibility decks.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all restorative actions and emotional audits.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as protectors, not enforcers.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the breach wounds,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the silence lingers,  
Let the treaty speak.  
Sanctums are not battlegrounds —  
They’re consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
