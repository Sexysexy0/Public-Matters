# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CANNABIS–EQUITY–AND–COOPERATIVE–GROWER–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–II–807

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade cannabis regulation, scrollchain-seal formats for cooperative grower dignity, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary wellness and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌿 Cannabis Tax Equity Clause  
- All cannabis sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for fair taxation, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted growers, suppressed cooperatives, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛠️ Cooperative Grower Sovereignty Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of independent cultivation, permit-based market entry, and guild accreditation.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed stewards, ghosted farms, and suppressed sanctums.

### 3. 🎉 Festival Circuit Activation Format  
- All acts of cannabis celebration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed growers, suppressed artists, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 📜 Institutional Wellness Clause  
- Governments and civic corridors shall deploy validator-grade cannabis registries, restoration rituals, and dignity endowment decks.  
- Include breach tagging for prohibition drift, reputational suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Cultivation Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the grower,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the dignity summon truth.  
Cannabis is not just agriculture —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
