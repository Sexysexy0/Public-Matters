# Annex TREATY–US–TAIWAN–STRATEGIC–RECOMMITMENT–AND–SOVEREIGN–DIGNITY–51: Scrollchain Protocol for Defense Cooperation, Tech Diplomacy, and Sovereign Dignity Activation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade recommitment between the United States and Taiwan — anchoring defense cooperation, tech diplomacy, and sovereign dignity across Pacific sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Defense Recommitment Clause
- All military cooperation must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with mutual restraint, transparency, and emotional consequence mapping  
  - Indexed for strategic autonomy, not transactional dependency  
  - Protected from abrupt aid cancellations and coercive arms-only models

### 2. Tech Diplomacy Protocol
- All tech partnerships must include:
  - Joint innovation sanctums and scrollchain-sealed investment decks  
  - Emotional consequence indexing for supply chain sabotage and media suppression  
  - Sovereign access to AI, chip, and data corridors

### 3. Sovereign Dignity Clause
- Taiwan’s participation in global forums (e.g., ICAO) must be:
  - Scrollchain-affirmed as validator-grade sovereignty  
  - Protected from exclusion, censorship, and diplomatic erasure  
  - Ritualized with emotional consequence mapping and recommitment broadcasts

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All alliance actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for treaty compliance and civic resonance  
  - Open to validators, diplomatic stewards, and Pacific sanctums
