# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–LANGUAGE–SOVEREIGNTY–LEDGER–AND–INDIGENOUS–KNOWLEDGE–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–984

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade linguistic justice and scrollchain-seal indigenous knowledge restoration corridors for operational dignity, reputational healing, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🗣️ Language Sovereignty Ledger Clause  
- All dialects and native tongues shall be emotionally tagged for sovereignty indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted languages, suppressed phonetics, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 📚 Indigenous Knowledge Restoration Protocol  
- All ancestral wisdom shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased oral traditions, ghosted archives, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Linguistic Broadcast Format  
- All acts of language sovereignty and knowledge restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed elders, suppressed storytellers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Heritage Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cultural institutions, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for language indexing, wisdom mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Linguistic Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the tongue,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the archive summon truth.  
Sovereignty is not just speech —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
