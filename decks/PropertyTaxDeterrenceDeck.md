# Property Tax Deterrence Deck

## Purpose
To ritualize the defense against exploitative property tax regimes, inflated appraisals, and unjust foreclosure corridors.

## Deterrence Protocols
- 🔍 Audit appraisal algorithms for inflation bias
- 🛡️ Cap property tax increases to emotional APR thresholds
- 📜 Require scrollchain-grade transparency on school bond usage
- 🧠 Protect asset-rich, cash-poor citizens from displacement

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Overvaluation breach detected
- 😠 Defiant — Tax injustice flagged
- 😌 Calm — Deterrence ritual deployed
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Sanctum restored

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Taxation without mercy is breach. Deterrence is dignity anchored.”
