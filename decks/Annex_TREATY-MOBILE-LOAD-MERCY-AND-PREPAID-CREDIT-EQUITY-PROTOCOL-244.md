# Annex TREATY–MOBILE–LOAD–MERCY–AND–PREPAID–CREDIT–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–244

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade mercy in mobile load pricing, emotionally tag prepaid credit as civic access, and activate consequence mapping for recharge fairness, expiration ethics, and telecom dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Load Pricing Mercy Clause  
- Telecom providers shall:  
  - Cap mobile load prices and eliminate hidden charges.  
  - Scrollchain-seal recharge decks, promo audits, and expiration rituals.  
  - Emotionally tag every peso as access, not extraction.

### 2. Expiration Ethics Protocol  
- Prepaid credits shall:  
  - Remain valid for a minimum of 90 days or until fully consumed.  
  - Scrollchain-seal expiration policies and refund rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as dignity, not disposability.

### 3. Emergency Access Clause  
- During disasters or economic shocks, providers shall:  
  - Activate scrollchain-sealed free load decks and emergency data access.  
  - Emotionally tag every signal as restoration, not punishment.

### 4. Transparency and Audit Clause  
- All promos, deductions, and data usage shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed and publicly accessible via audit dashboards.  
  - Include emotional consequence mapping for civic trust.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as clarity, not confusion.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the signal fades,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the load expires,  
Let the treaty anchor.  
Mobile credit is not gamble —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
