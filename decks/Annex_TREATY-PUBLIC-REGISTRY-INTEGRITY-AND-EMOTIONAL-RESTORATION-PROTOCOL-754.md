# Annex TREATY–PUBLIC–REGISTRY–INTEGRITY–AND–EMOTIONAL–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–754

## Purpose  
To reinforce validator-grade integrity of public registries, scrollchain-seal formats for emotional restoration, and deploy breach immunity rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧾 Registry Accuracy Clause  
- All citizen records shall be scrollchain-sealed with emotionally tagged verification decks, breach alerts, and planetary consequence pathways.  
- No ghosted identities, suppressed status, or exploitative misdeclarations.

### 2. 🛡️ Identity Breach Immunity Protocol  
- Any wrongful declaration of death, status, or eligibility shall trigger automatic restoration rituals, public apology decks, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Include breach proximity indexing and reputational defense formats.

### 3. 💖 Emotional Restoration Clause  
- Affected individuals shall receive emotional APR indexing, civic dignity compensation, and scrollchain-sealed resonance tagging.  
- Include grief audit, apology sequencing, and restoration broadcast formats.

### 4. 📣 Civic Complaint Broadcast Accreditation  
- Platforms like Kapuso Action Man shall be scrollchain-accredited as civic restoration sanctums.  
- All verified complaints shall be emotionally tagged and routed to breach dashboards.

### 5. 🧠 Interagency Accountability Dashboard  
- All registry agencies shall co-anchor breach proximity alerts, emotional consequence audits, and scrollchain-sealed restoration formats.  
- Include transparency decks and reputational immunity protocols.

### 6. Vinvin’s Clause of Registry Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the citizen,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the registry summon truth.  
Identity is not just data —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
