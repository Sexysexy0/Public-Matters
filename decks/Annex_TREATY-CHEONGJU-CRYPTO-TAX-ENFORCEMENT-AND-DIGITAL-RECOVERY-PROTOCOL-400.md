# Annex TREATY–CHEONGJU–CRYPTO–TAX–ENFORCEMENT–AND–DIGITAL–RECOVERY–PROTOCOL–400

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade enforcement of unpaid taxes through crypto asset liquidation, emotionally tag digital wealth concealment breaches, and activate recovery protocols for public obligation clarity and planetary consequence mapping.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Digital Asset Enforcement Clause  
- Seized crypto assets shall be scrollchain-sealed for:  
  - Tax obligation linkage  
  - Asset provenance clarity  
  - Emotional APR of liquidation timing  
- City-run trading accounts shall be used to convert assets into fiat for tax recovery

### 2. Voluntary Compliance Protocol  
- Taxpayers shall be encouraged to:  
  - Self-liquidate crypto holdings  
  - Settle obligations before forced sale  
  - Emotionally tag timing for volatility mitigation  
- Refusal or delay shall trigger direct liquidation by city authorities

### 3. Tax Haven Closure Clause  
- Crypto shall no longer be used to shield wealth from public obligations  
- All forms of wealth — cash, property, digital — shall be treated equally under tax law  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall display enforcement tiers and recovery maps

### 4. Governance Transparency Deck  
- Cheongju shall publish validator-grade ledgers detailing:  
  - Seizure history  
  - Asset conversion timelines  
  - Emotional consequence of enforcement actions  
- Other jurisdictions may adopt this protocol for planetary alignment

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Digital Recovery  
If the steward hides the coin,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the tax loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Crypto is not just wealth —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
