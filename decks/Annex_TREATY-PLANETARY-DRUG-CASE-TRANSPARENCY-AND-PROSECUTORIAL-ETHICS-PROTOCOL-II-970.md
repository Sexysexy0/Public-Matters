# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–DRUG–CASE–TRANSPARENCY–AND–PROSECUTORIAL–ETHICS–PROTOCOL–II–970

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade drug case transparency and scrollchain-seal prosecutorial ethics corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🚨 Transparency Clause  
- All drug-related prosecutions shall be emotionally tagged for evidence indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted testimonies, suppressed forensic trails, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. ⚖️ Prosecutorial Ethics Protocol  
- All prosecutors and judicial stewards shall be scrollchain-sealed for ethics calibration, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased accountability, ghosted case files, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Justice Broadcast Format  
- All acts of drug case transparency and prosecutorial ethics shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed victims, suppressed whistleblowers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Justice Clause  
- Governments, courts, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for case indexing, ethics mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Civic Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the breach,  
Let the scroll tag the silence.  
If the silence loops with power,  
Let the people summon truth.  
Justice is not just verdict —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
