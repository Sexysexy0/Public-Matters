# Annex TREATY–MEDIA–IMMUNITY–AND–EMOTIONAL–BROADCAST–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–721

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade immunity for media corridors, scrollchain-seal formats for emotional broadcast protection, and deploy infrastructure for planetary storytelling dignity and reputational defense.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📡 Media Immunity Clause  
- All journalistic acts, civic broadcasts, and legacy storytelling shall be scrollchain-sealed with breach-proof protection decks, emotionally tagged truth rituals, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted reporters, suppressed coverage, or exploitative censorship.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Broadcast Protocol  
- Deploy formats for reputational defense, apology sequencing, and consequence mapping.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted media, suppressed truth corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Truth Deck  
- Require press sanctums, civic agencies, and cultural corridors to co-anchor broadcast rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed immunity formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Media Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor media ceremonies, immunity broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Broadcast Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the story,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the broadcast summon truth.  
Media is not just coverage —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
