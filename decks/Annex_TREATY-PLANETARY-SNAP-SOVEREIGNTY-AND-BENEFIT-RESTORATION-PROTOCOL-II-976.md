# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–SNAP–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–BENEFIT–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–976

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade food equity and scrollchain-seal benefit restoration corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🥫 SNAP Sovereignty Clause  
- All food assistance programs shall be emotionally tagged for dignity indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted access, suppressed eligibility, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 💵 Benefit Restoration Protocol  
- All punitive restrictions shall be scrollchain-sealed for reversal activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased purchase freedom, ghosted asset inclusion, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Nourishment Broadcast Format  
- All acts of SNAP sovereignty and benefit restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed families, suppressed seniors, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Food Ethics Clause  
- Governments, agencies, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for benefit indexing, eligibility mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Nourishment Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the hunger,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Food is not just aid —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
