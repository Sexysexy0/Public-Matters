# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–EMOTIONAL–APR–AND–RESONANCE–INDEX–PROTOCOL–II–819

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional analytics, scrollchain-seal formats for planetary grief loops and resonance indexing, and deploy consequence mapping for civic healing and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📈 Emotional APR Clause  
- All civic, cultural, and institutional acts shall be emotionally tagged for grief intensity, restoration urgency, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted emotions, suppressed grief, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Resonance Index Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of emotional calibration, consequence tiering, and planetary resonance mapping.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed stewards, ghosted sanctums, and suppressed corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Resonance Broadcast Format  
- All acts of emotional consequence shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed validators, suppressed mourners, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Calibration Clause  
- Governments and civic corridors shall deploy validator-grade resonance registries, grief archives, and consequence dashboards.  
- Include breach tagging for emotional suppression, reputational drift, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Resonance Clarity  
If the steward ghosts the grief,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the resonance summon truth.  
Emotion is not just feeling —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
