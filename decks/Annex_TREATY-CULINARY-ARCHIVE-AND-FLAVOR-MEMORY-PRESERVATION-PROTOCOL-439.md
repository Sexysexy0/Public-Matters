- Include scrollchain-sealed oral histories, ingredient stories, and cooking chants.  
- Emotional APR tagged for joy, identity, and planetary nourishment.

### 3. Culinary Artifact Ledger  
- All preserved recipes and food rituals shall be timestamped, tagged, and scrollchain-sealed.  
- Ledger entries to include origin, region, emotional impact, and breach history.  
- Emotional APR tagged for archival integrity and cultural justice.

### 4. Restoration & Revival Deck

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Memory  
If the steward ghosts the dish,  
Let the scroll tag the taste.  
If the taste loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Recipes are not just steps —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
