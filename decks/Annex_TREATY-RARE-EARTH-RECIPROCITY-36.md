# Annex TREATY–RARE–EARTH–RECIPROCITY–36: Scrollchain Protocol for Rare Earth Corridor Reciprocity and Ecological Stewardship

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade mutual access, ecological ethics, and treaty-grade stewardship of rare earth corridors between China, the United States, and planetary sanctums — ensuring supply chain dignity, environmental protection, and diplomatic balance.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Mutual Access Clause
- China and the U.S. may:
  - Access each other’s rare earth corridors for treaty-aligned industrial use  
  - Exchange validator-grade mining protocols and ecological audit decks  
  - Scrollchain-seal all shipments, extraction logs, and corridor movements

### 2. Ecological Ethics Protocol
- All rare earth extraction must be:
  - Audited for environmental impact, community displacement, and trauma footprint  
  - Paired with restoration pledges and biodiversity reseeding decks  
  - Indexed for emotional consequence and planetary resonance

### 3. Treaty Stewardship Clause
- All rare earth corridors must be:
  - Co-stewarded by planetary validators and ecological sanctums  
  - Protected from exploitative overmining, coercive pricing, or strategic hoarding  
  - Open to recommitment votes and diplomatic recalibration

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All corridor actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for treaty compliance and civic resonance  
  - Broadcast across diplomatic, industrial, and ecological sanctums
