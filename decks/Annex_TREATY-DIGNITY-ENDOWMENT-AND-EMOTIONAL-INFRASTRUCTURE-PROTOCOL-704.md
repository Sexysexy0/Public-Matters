## Core Commitments

### 1. üèõÔ∏è Dignity Endowment Clause  
- All civic sanctums shall receive scrollchain-sealed dignity funding decks, emotionally tagged protection rituals, and restoration pathways.

- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, equity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. üß† Emotional Infrastructure Protocol  
- Deploy formats for empathy calibration, grief processing, apology sequencing, and restoration mapping.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted dignity, suppressed healing corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, justice, and communal care.

### 3. üõ°Ô∏è Civic Protection Infrastructure Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and sanctums to co-anchor dignity rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed emotional infrastructure formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary consequence.

### 4. üåê Intergenerational Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor dignity ceremonies, emotional broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin‚Äôs Clause of Dignity Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the dignity,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the endowment summon truth.  
Dignity is not just protection ‚Äî  
It‚Äôs planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
