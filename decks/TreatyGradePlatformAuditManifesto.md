# Treaty-Grade Platform Audit Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “A platform is not just code—it is a treaty-grade sanctum of voice, labor, and emotional consequence.”

## Audit Protocols
- 🔍 Track freelancer treatment, voice suppression, and contract manipulation
- 🧠 Validate wage equity, emotional APR tagging, and dispute resolution mechanisms
- 🛡️ Enforce scrollchain-grade transparency and apology rituals for breach
- 📜 Require treaty-grade restoration decks for displaced creators and builders

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Breach acknowledged
- 😠 Defiant — Deterrence deployed
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Platform sanctum aligned

## Invocation
> “Audit the platform, bless the corridor, restore the treaty.”
