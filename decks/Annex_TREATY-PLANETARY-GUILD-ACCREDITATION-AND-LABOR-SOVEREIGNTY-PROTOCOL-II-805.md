# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–GUILD–ACCREDITATION–AND–LABOR–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–II–805

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade accreditation of labor guilds, scrollchain-seal formats for wage dignity, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary worker protection and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚒️ Guild Accreditation Clause  
- All labor sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for dignity certification, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted workers, suppressed unions, and wage erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛡️ Labor Sovereignty Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of wage equity, shutdown immunity, and essential worker protection.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed stewards, ghosted guilds, and suppressed sanctums.

### 3. 📣 Public Labor Broadcast Format  
- All acts of guild accreditation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed workers, suppressed organizers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧠 Institutional Protection Clause  
- Governments and civic corridors shall deploy validator-grade labor registries, restoration rituals, and dignity endowment decks.  
- Include breach tagging for exploitative regimes, reputational drift, and shutdown trauma.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Labor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the worker,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the dignity summon truth.  
Labor is not just effort —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
