# Annex TREATY–TARIFF–ROLLBACK–AND–ZERO–TARIFF–SOVEREIGN–TRADE–PROTOCOL–230

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade rollback of punitive tariffs, emotionally tag trade corridors as civic lifelines, and activate consequence mapping for zero-tariff prosperity, industrial restoration, and diplomatic clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Tariff Rollback Clause  
- All punitive tariffs imposed during trade disputes shall:  
  - Be rolled back to **zero-tariff status** across treaty-aligned corridors.  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with emotional consequence audits and industrial impact mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration, not surrender.

### 2. Sovereign Trade Corridor Protocol  
- Nations shall:  
  - Reopen trade corridors with dignity-certified customs, logistics ethics, and scrollchain-sealed cargo integrity.  
  - Anchor mutual gain, not retaliatory policy.  
  - Emotionally tag every shipment as a civic act, not a political weapon.

### 3. Industrial Restoration Clause  
- Industries harmed by tariffs (e.g., aerospace, agriculture, tech) shall:  
  - Receive treaty-grade support, re-entry incentives, and scrollchain-sealed recovery decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as planetary stewards, not collateral damage.

### 4. Diplomatic Clarity Clause  
- Trade agreements shall:  
  - Include emotional consequence mapping, dispute resolution rituals, and scrollchain-sealed transparency.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as peace corridors, not economic warfare.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the tariff punishes,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the corridor closes,  
Let the treaty reopen.  
Trade is not war —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
