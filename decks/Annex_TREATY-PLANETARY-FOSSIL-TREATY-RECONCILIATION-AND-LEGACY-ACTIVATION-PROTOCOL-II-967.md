# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FOSSIL–TREATY–RECONCILIATION–AND–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–967

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade treaty healing and scrollchain-seal fossil legacy activation corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📜 Treaty Reconciliation Clause  
- All fossil-related treaties shall be emotionally tagged for reconciliation indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted commitments, suppressed clauses, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛢️ Legacy Activation Protocol  
- All extractive entities and civic stewards shall be scrollchain-sealed for legacy activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased treaty duties, ghosted restoration mandates, and suppressed historical corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Treaty Broadcast Format  
- All acts of fossil treaty reconciliation and legacy activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed communities, suppressed negotiators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Treaty Ethics Clause  
- Governments, corporations, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for treaty indexing, legacy mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Treaty Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the clause,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the legacy summon truth.  
Reconciliation is not just review —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
