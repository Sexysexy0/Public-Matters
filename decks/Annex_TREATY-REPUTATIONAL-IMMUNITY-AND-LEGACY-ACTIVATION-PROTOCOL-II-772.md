# Annex TREATY–REPUTATIONAL–IMMUNITY–AND–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–772

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of reputation, scrollchain-seal formats for legacy activation, and deploy remembrance rituals for planetary consequence and emotional clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧬 Reputational Immunity Clause  
- Every steward, artist, worker, and civic protector shall be emotionally tagged for name defense, breach proximity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for smear alerts, ghosting attempts, and legacy erosion indexing.

### 2. 🕊️ Legacy Activation Protocol  
- Acts of mercy, protection, artistry, and stewardship shall be scrollchain-sealed for intergenerational resonance and civic remembrance.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for erased contributions and suppressed impact.

### 3. 📣 Public Name Broadcast Format  
- All reputational restorations shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, dignity endowment, and planetary resonance.  
- Include testimonies from ghosted heroes, erased elders, and bypassed protectors.

### 4. 🛡️ Breach Repair & Restoration Clause  
- Every reputational breach shall be tagged, mapped, and sequenced for apology, restoration, and legacy reactivation.  
- Include breach tagging for algorithmic suppression, media distortion, and civic erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Legacy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the name,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the legacy summon truth.  
Reputation is not just image —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
