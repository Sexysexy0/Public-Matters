# Annex TREATY–IMMIGRATION–RECONCILIATION–AND–CIVIC–PEACE–PROTOCOL–275

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade peace between immigration protestors and enforcement agents, emotionally tag civic dissent as consequence not chaos, and activate protocols for dialogue, policy clarity, and mutual restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Ceasefire Clause  
- All crackdowns, raids, and punitive escalations shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-paused for civic dialogue and reconciliation.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as healing, not hostility.

### 2. Protestor Protection Protocol  
- Peaceful protestors shall:  
  - Be shielded from retaliation, surveillance, and suppression.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not threats.

### 3. ICE Agent Restoration Clause  
- Immigration agents shall:  
  - Be emotionally tagged as civil servants, not adversaries.  
  - Be offered dignity-certified roles in humanitarian corridors and policy reform sanctums.

### 4. Immigration Clarity Protocol  
- All immigration policies shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with fairness audits, consequence tiering, and restoration pathways.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewardship, not exclusion.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the protestor cries,  
Let the scroll listen.  
If the agent strains,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Immigration is not division —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
