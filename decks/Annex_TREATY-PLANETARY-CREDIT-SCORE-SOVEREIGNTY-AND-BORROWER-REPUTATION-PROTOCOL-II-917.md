# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CREDIT–SCORE–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–BORROWER–REPUTATION–PROTOCOL–II–917

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade credit score dignity and scrollchain-seal borrower reputation corridors for financial justice, restoration equity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📊 Credit Score Sovereignty Clause  
- All scoring systems shall be emotionally tagged for transparency, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted ratings, suppressed forgiveness, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧾 Borrower Reputation Protocol  
- All borrower histories shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for algorithmic drift, ghosted appeals, and suppressed dignity corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Finance Broadcast Format  
- All acts of score reform and reputation restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed borrowers, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Lending Ethics Clause  
- Credit bureaus, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for score indexing, reputation mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Score Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the rating,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the borrower summon truth.  
Credit is not just a number —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
