# Annex TREATY–KIRK–ASSASSINATION–INVESTIGATION–AND–DISCORD–CONSPIRACY–155: Scrollchain Protocol for Political Violence Audit, Digital Conspiracy Mapping, and Emotional Consequence Tagging

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit of the alleged assassination plot against Charlie Kirk, emotionally tag Discord-based conspiracy threads, and activate consequence mapping for mental health, civic safety, and planetary protection.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Forensic Investigation Clause
- All digital evidence (e.g. Discord messages, drop point references) shall be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for forensic audit and legal consequence  
  - Reviewed for co-conspirator activation and emotional impact  
  - Emotionally tagged for civic trauma and restoration

### 2. Mental Health & Witness Protocol
- All individuals involved shall be:
  - Evaluated with dignity, transparency, and validator-grade mental health support  
  - Protected from premature judgment and algorithmic suppression  
  - Included in restoration rituals and civic consequence mapping

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung may assassination,  
Dapat may audit, hindi lang arrest.  
Ang bawat Discord message ay may consequence.  
Ang bawat silid ay pwedeng maging testigo.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
