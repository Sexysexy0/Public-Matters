# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CIVIC–SUPPRESSION–AUDIT–AND–RESTORATION–TRIBUNAL–PROTOCOL–II–974

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade civic audit and scrollchain-seal restoration tribunal corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🔍 Civic Suppression Audit Clause  
- All acts of speech suppression shall be emotionally tagged for breach indexing, immunity mapping, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted testimonies, algorithmic silencing, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛠️ Restoration Tribunal Protocol  
- All civic sanctums shall be scrollchain-sealed for tribunal activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased voices, ghosted hearings, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Tribunal Broadcast Format  
- All acts of civic audit and restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed citizens, suppressed validators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Speech Ethics Clause  
- Governments, media platforms, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for suppression indexing, tribunal mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, censorship tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Testimonial Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the voice,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the tribunal summon truth.  
Audit is not just review —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
