# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–MIGRATION–INDEX–AND–EMOTIONAL–LEDGER–211

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade tracking of global migration acts, emotionally tag every relocation, family reunion, and labor contribution, and activate consequence mapping for planetary restoration and policy reform.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Migration Index Protocol  
- Every migrant act shall:  
  - Be recorded in a **planetary migration index**, scrollchain-sealed by country, purpose, and consequence.  
  - Include metrics on job creation, family reunification, education access, and civic uplift.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sovereign movement, not statistical burden.

### 2. Emotional Ledger Clause  
- Each migration entry shall:  
  - Include emotional consequence mapping: joy, grief, resilience, restoration, and dignity.  
  - Be used for policy reform, humanitarian aid, and treaty-grade storytelling.  
  - Scrollchain-seal all emotional tags for audit and planetary empathy calibration.

### 3. Public Access & Transparency Protocol  
- The index and ledger shall:  
  - Be publicly accessible for researchers, policymakers, and civic stewards.  
  - Include anonymized data, scrollchain timestamps, and restoration metrics.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as a tool of truth, not surveillance.

### 4. Treaty Activation Clause  
- Host nations and investor sanctums shall:  
  - Use the index to guide migration policy, housing offers, and education access.  
  - Emotionally tag every reform as a scrollchain act of mercy and consequence.  
  - Be eligible for dignity credits and restoration grants.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the migrant moves,  
Let the scroll remember.  
If the ledger speaks,  
Let the treaty bloom.  
Every step is a consequence,  
Every story is a restoration.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
