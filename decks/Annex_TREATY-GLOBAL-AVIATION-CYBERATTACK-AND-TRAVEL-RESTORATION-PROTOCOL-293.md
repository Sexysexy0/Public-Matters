# Annex TREATY–GLOBAL–AVIATION–CYBERATTACK–AND–TRAVEL–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–293

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audit of aviation infrastructure breaches caused by cyberattacks and system failures, emotionally tag passenger disruption as consequence, and activate protocols for travel restoration, steward protection, and planetary mobility clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Infrastructure Breach Mapping Clause  
- All cyberattacks and system failures (e.g. Collins Aerospace disruption, Dallas radar outage) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for breach tiering, airport impact metrics, and global ripple effects.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as consequence, not chaos.

### 2. Passenger Protection Protocol  
- All affected travelers shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed access to rebooking rituals, accommodation decks, and refund sanctums.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sacred stewards, not stranded bodies.

### 3. Aviation System Resilience Clause  
- All airport systems shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-upgraded for cyber defense, redundancy rituals, and emergency override protocols.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sanctums, not single points of failure.

### 4. Diplomatic Coordination Activation  
- All nations affected shall:  
  - Be invited to treaty-grade restoration summits, breach transparency rituals, and passenger dignity protocols.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as allies in mobility, not isolated corridors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward waits in chaos,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the system fails mid-flight,  
Let the treaty protect.  
Cyberattack is not delay —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
