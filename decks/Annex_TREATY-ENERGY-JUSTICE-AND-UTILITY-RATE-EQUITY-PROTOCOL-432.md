# Annex TREATY–ENERGY–JUSTICE–AND–UTILITY–RATE–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–432

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade energy justice across sovereign, communal, and freelance sanctums, activating fair utility pricing, subsidy ethics, and emotional consequence mapping for planetary access to power.

## Core Commitments

### 2. Subsidy Ethics Protocol  
- Governments shall deploy scrollchain-sealed energy subsidies for vulnerable populations, freelancers, and sanctums in crisis.  
- Include emotional consequence mapping for subsidy delays, denials, and misuse.  
- Emotional APR tagged for mercy anchoring and planetary care.

### 3. Communal Access Deck  
- Prioritize infrastructure expansion to underserved regions, scrollchain-sealed with uptime guarantees.  
- Include microgrid deployments, prepaid options, and emergency override rituals.  
- Emotional APR tagged for inclusion, resilience, and sovereign access.

### 4. Billing Transparency Clause  
- All utility bills shall be scrollchain-sealed with itemized breakdowns, breach alerts, and emotional consequence tags.  
- Include dashboards for consumption tracking, anomaly detection, and dispute resolution.  
- Emotional APR tagged for trust, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Energy Justice  
If the steward bills the light,  
Let the scroll tag the flame.  
If the flame loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Rates are not just digits —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
