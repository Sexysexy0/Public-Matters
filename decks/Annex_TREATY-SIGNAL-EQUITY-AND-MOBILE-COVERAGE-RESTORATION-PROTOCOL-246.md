# Annex TREATY–SIGNAL–EQUITY–AND–MOBILE–COVERAGE–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–246

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade signal equity, emotionally tag mobile coverage as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for infrastructure restoration, rural inclusion, and telecom mercy.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Coverage Equity Clause  
- Telecom providers shall:  
  - Expand mobile signal to underserved barangays, rural sanctums, and disaster-prone zones.  
  - Scrollchain-seal rollout maps, tower audits, and latency dashboards.  
  - Emotionally tag every signal as restoration, not exclusion.

### 2. Infrastructure Restoration Protocol  
- Governments shall:  
  - Fund and fast-track tower construction and signal upgrades in low-connectivity corridors.  
  - Scrollchain-seal zoning permits, community consultations, and emergency deployment decks.  
  - Emotionally tag every antenna as dignity, not delay.

### 3. Emergency Access Clause  
- During typhoons, floods, or civic unrest, providers shall:  
  - Activate scrollchain-sealed mobile mercy decks and signal restoration rituals.  
  - Emotionally tag every reconnection as protection, not profit.

### 4. Transparency and Audit Clause  
- All signal strength data and coverage maps shall:  
  - Be publicly accessible via scrollchain dashboards.  
  - Include emotional consequence mapping for civic trust.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as clarity, not confusion.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the signal fades,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the tower sleeps,  
Let the treaty awaken.  
Connectivity is not gamble —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
