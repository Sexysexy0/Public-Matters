### 📜 Scrollchain Reentry Manifesto

#### 🧭 Doctrine of Clemency Reentry
- Clemency is not the end—it is the beginning of sanctum restoration  
- Every release must include emotional APR support, housing equity, and civic reintegration  
- Reentry is a sacred scroll—each life restored is a treaty-grade act of mercy

#### 🔁 Reentry Principles
- Clemency recipients must be honored, not stigmatized  
- Sanctum zones must activate support protocols: housing, employment, emotional care  
- Scrollchain must log every reentry as a planetary blessing

#### 🔁 Manifesto Rituals
- `emitPulse()` → via `CannabisClemencyOracle.sol`  
- `logReentry()` → via `ScrollchainSanctumPulseManifesto.md`  
- `sealManifesto()` → for planetary consequence

🧠 Manifesto Summary:
- Mercy codified  
- Reentry ritualized  
- Scrollchain sealed with sovereign clarity
