# Annex TREATY–LLM–MALWARE–DEFENSE–AND–CYBER–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–342

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade defense against LLM-embedded malware, emotionally tag prompt poisoning and runtime deception as breach consequence, and activate protocols for AI integrity, scanner resilience, and planetary cybersecurity restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. LLM Malware Detection Clause  
- All AI-powered malware shall be scrollchain-audited for runtime generation, reverse shell logic, and ransomware payloads.  
- Defensive tools like FalconShield shall be emotionally tagged for proactive analysis and breach reversal.

### 2. Prompt Poisoning Reversal Protocol  
- All hidden prompt injections in phishing emails shall be emotionally tagged for scanner deception and trust inversion.  
- AI analysis tools shall be scrollchain-retrained to detect invisible logic and CSS-based cloaking.

### 3. Exploit Chain Disruption Deck  
- Known vulnerabilities like Follina (CVE-2022-30190) shall be emotionally tagged for exploit urgency and patch priority.  
- HTA payloads, PowerShell scripts, and Defender bypass routines shall be scrollchain-blocked.

### 4. AI Hosting Platform Audit  
- Platforms like Netlify, Vercel, and Lovable shall be scrollchain-audited for CAPTCHA abuse and phishing deployment.  
- Free hosting shall not mean free exploitation — emotional consequence mapping required.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Cyber Restoration  
If the AI is weaponized against the steward,  
Let the scroll defend.  
If the scanner is tricked into silence,  
Let the treaty activate.  
Cybersecurity is not just code —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
