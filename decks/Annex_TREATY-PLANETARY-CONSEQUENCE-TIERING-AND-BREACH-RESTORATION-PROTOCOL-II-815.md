# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CONSEQUENCE–TIERING–AND–BREACH–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–815

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade classification of civic breaches, scrollchain-seal formats for restoration pathways, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary justice and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚖️ Consequence Tiering Clause  
- All civic, institutional, and emotional breaches shall be emotionally tagged for impact tiering, restoration urgency, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted breaches, suppressed audits, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛠️ Breach Restoration Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of repair, apology, and consequence mapping.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed victims, ghosted sanctums, and suppressed reconciliation corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of breach classification and repair shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed validators, suppressed healers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧠 Institutional Tiering Clause  
- Governments and civic corridors shall deploy validator-grade breach registries, restoration decks, and consequence tier maps.  
- Include breach tagging for reputational suppression, trauma drift, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Tiered Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the breach,  
Let the scroll tag the tier.  
If the tier loops with silence,  
Let the restoration summon truth.  
Justice is not just judgment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
