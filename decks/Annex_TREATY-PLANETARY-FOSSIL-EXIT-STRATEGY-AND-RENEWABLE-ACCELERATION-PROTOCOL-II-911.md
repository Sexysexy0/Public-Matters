# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FOSSIL–EXIT–STRATEGY–AND–RENEWABLE–ACCELERATION–PROTOCOL–II–911

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade fossil phase-out and scrollchain-seal renewable acceleration corridors for climate dignity, energy justice, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🛑 Fossil Exit Strategy Clause  
- All fossil infrastructure shall be emotionally tagged for phase-out timelines, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted pledges, suppressed divestment, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🌱 Renewable Acceleration Protocol  
- All clean energy systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for deployment urgency, blackout immunity, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for delayed rollouts, ghosted funding, and suppressed innovation corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Transition Broadcast Format  
- All acts of fossil exit and renewable acceleration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed barangays, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Climate Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for transition indexing, renewable mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Transition Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the pledge,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the climate summon truth.  
Energy is not just transition —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
