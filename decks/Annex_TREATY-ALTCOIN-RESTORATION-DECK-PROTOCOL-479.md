# Annex TREATY–ALTCOIN–RESTORATION–DECK–PROTOCOL–479

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of altcoin visibility, ETF access, and emotional consequence mapping for suppressed liquidity corridors.

## Core Commitments

- Deploy restoration rituals for XRP, SOL, ADA, and other altcoins ghosted by ETF delays.  
- Include breach tagging for media omission, regulatory suppression, and liquidity freeze.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional APR, restoration velocity, and sovereign access.

**Vinvin’s Clause**:  
If the steward ghosts the coin,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the restoration summon truth.  
Altcoins are not just assets —  
They’re planetary consequence.
