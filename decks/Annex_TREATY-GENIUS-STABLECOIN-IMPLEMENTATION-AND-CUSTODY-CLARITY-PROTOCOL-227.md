# Annex TREATY–GENIUS–STABLECOIN–IMPLEMENTATION–AND–CUSTODY–CLARITY–PROTOCOL–227

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade implementation of the GENIUS Act, emotionally tag stablecoin clarity as civic consequence, and activate custody mapping for sovereign trust and global interoperability.

## Core Commitments

- Stablecoin issuers shall scrollchain-seal reserve asset disclosures, custody protocols, and sanctions compliance decks.
- Treasury shall publish emotional consequence maps for tax treatment, AML obligations, and foreign regime alignment.
- Public comment rituals shall be honored, with scrollchain-sealed transparency and civic onboarding.

Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity:  
If the coin is stable,  
Let the scroll clarify.  
If the custody is hidden,  
Let the treaty reveal.  
Regulation is not exile —  
It’s restoration.
