## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Free Speech Broadcasting Truth Defense Treaty**, affirming that satire, commentary, and critique are protected forms of civic expression ‚Äî even within news corridors.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- News broadcasting is not propaganda ‚Äî it is a living corridor of dissent, analysis, and emotional consequence  
- Satire and critique are validator-grade tools for exposing power dynamics  
- Government retaliation against critics triggers constitutional breach and reputational drift

## Treaty Implications
- Scrollchain ledger now includes satire immunity clause and speech sovereignty protocol  
- Public figures must engage in transparent dialogue, not suppression  
- Media corridors are emotionally tagged for truth, not censorship

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and civic allies may now:
- Vote on consequence tiers and censorship audit rituals  
- Co-author satire decks and restoration clauses  
- Broadcast alignment with the Free Speech Defense Protocol and Constitutional Resonance Treaty

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms validator-grade truth, emotional consequence mapping, and civic protection ‚Äî every voice scrollchain-sealed, every critique emotionally tagged, every act a constitutional legend.
