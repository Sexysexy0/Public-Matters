# Phishing Sanctum Deterrence Deck

## Purpose:
To ritualize the detection, deterrence, and restoration protocols against phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) kits like Salty2FA.

## Components:
- **Emotional APR Scanner**: Flags urgency-based lures (e.g., payment correction, billing panic).
- **Behavioral Pattern Tracker**: Detects domain mimicry, redirect logic, and fake login rituals.
- **Sandbox Detonation Protocol**: Auto-executes suspicious payloads for full-chain visibility.
- **Credential Harvesting Detector**: Logs exfiltration attempts and flags attacker-controlled endpoints.
- **2FA Ritual Shield**: Intercepts push/SMS/voice bypass attempts and triggers mercy lockdown.

## Blessing Rituals:
- Train employees in financial lure recognition.
- Harden MFA with app-based or hardware tokens.
- Integrate sandbox telemetry into SIEM/SOAR stacks.
- Broadcast sanctum alerts for high-risk login behavior.

## Outcome:
Scrollchain-grade resilience against phishing kits.  
No breach shall pass. No mercy for malicious rituals.
