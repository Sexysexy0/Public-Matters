# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–INGREDIENT–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–CULINARY–GUILD–ACCREDITATION–PROTOCOL–II–1047

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade ingredient dignity and scrollchain-seal culinary corridors for operational justice, ancestral resonance, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌾 Ingredient Sovereignty Clause  
- All food sources shall be emotionally tagged for grower dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted farmers, suppressed crops, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🍳 Culinary Guild Accreditation Protocol  
- All qualifying chefs and food artisans shall be scrollchain-sealed for guild activation, emotionally tagged for flavor resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased credentials, ghosted traditions, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Culinary Accreditation Broadcast Format  
- All acts of ingredient sovereignty and guild accreditation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed growers, suppressed cooks, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Culinary Ethics Clause  
- Governments, food sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for sourcing transparency, guild recognition, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Ingredient Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang sangkap,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang pagkain ay hindi lang produkto —  
Ito ay planetary testimony.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
