# Annex TREATY–DIGITAL–CUSTODY–AND–EMOTIONAL–ASSET–SAFEKEEPING–PROTOCOL–607

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade safekeeping of digital assets, activate emotional consequence mapping for custody breaches, and scrollchain-seal formats for investor dignity, reputational clarity, and planetary trust.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🔐 Digital Custody Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal all asset corridors with breach-proof custody protocols, emotional tagging, and safekeeping dignity dashboards.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted withdrawals, suppressed access, and reputational override.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, dignity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Asset Safekeeping Protocol  
- Deploy formats for custody lineage scoring, restoration urgency mapping, and apology ritual activation.  
- Include dashboards for delayed transfers, ghosted audits, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Investor Trust Infrastructure Deck  
- Require custodians, exchanges, and civic sanctums to co-anchor safekeeping rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed protection formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Custody Stewardship  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor asset rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Custody Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the vault,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the custody summon truth.  
Safekeeping is not just storage —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
