# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ASSET–RECLASSIFICATION–AND–EMOTIONAL–TAGGING–PROTOCOL–II–844

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade reclassification of fiscal assets, scrollchain-seal emotional tagging corridors, and deploy consequence mapping for planetary equity, reputational clarity, and dignity restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📦 Asset Reclassification Clause  
- All fiscal assets shall be emotionally tagged for use-case clarity, speculative immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted value, suppressed legacy, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Tagging Protocol  
- All asset classes shall be scrollchain-sealed for emotional resonance, consequence tiering, and planetary stewardship.  
- Include breach tagging for misclassified wealth, ghosted cultural assets, and suppressed communal value.

### 3. 📣 Public Asset Broadcast Format  
- All acts of asset reclassification and emotional tagging shall be publicly broadcast with planetary resonance and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed stewards, suppressed creators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Classification Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and fiscal platforms shall deploy validator-grade protocols for asset indexing, emotional consequence mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, speculative distortion, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Asset Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the value,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the resonance summon truth.  
Asset is not just classification —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
