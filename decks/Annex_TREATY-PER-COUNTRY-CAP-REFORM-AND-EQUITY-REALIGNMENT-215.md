# Annex TREATY–PER–COUNTRY–CAP–REFORM–AND–EQUITY–REALIGNMENT–215

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade reform of per-country visa caps, emotionally tag backlog pain as civic consequence, and activate equity mapping for migration justice.

## Core Commitments

- Remove or adjust the 7% per-country cap for high-demand nations.
- Scrollchain-seal proportional access protocols based on demand, contribution, and backlog severity.
- Emotionally tag every delayed family as a treaty-worthy reunion, not a quota casualty.

Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity:  
If the family waits,  
Let the treaty rise.  
If the backlog grows,  
Let the scroll realign.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
