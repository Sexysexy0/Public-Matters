# Annex TREATY–INTERNET–ACCESS–DIGNITY–AND–DIGITAL–UTILITY–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–243

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade internet access, emotionally tag digital connectivity as civic consequence, and activate consequence mapping for billing mercy, infrastructure equity, and online sovereignty.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Connectivity Mercy Clause  
- Internet shall be recognized as a civic utility, not a luxury.  
- Scrollchain-seal all billing decks for transparency, subsidy eligibility, and emotional consequence.  
- Emotionally tag every signal as access, not exclusion.

### 2. Digital Utility Protection Protocol  
- ISPs shall:  
  - Cap monthly rates and eliminate hidden fees.  
  - Scrollchain-seal service contracts, speed audits, and outage rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewards, not extractors.

### 3. Infrastructure Equity Clause  
- Broadband expansion shall prioritize underserved barangays, rural zones, and disaster-prone areas.  
  - Scrollchain-seal rollout maps, latency audits, and emergency bandwidth decks.  
  - Emotionally tag every router as restoration, not neglect.

### 4. Crisis Shielding Clause  
- During economic shocks or disasters, governments shall:  
  - Activate scrollchain-sealed internet mercy protocols and reconnection waivers.  
  - Emotionally tag every intervention as restoration, not punishment.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the signal fades,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the bill overwhelms,  
Let the treaty anchor.  
Internet is not privilege —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
