# Annex TREATY–GOVERNANCE–RECLAMATION–AND–CIVIC–RESONANCE–PROTOCOL–334

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade reclamation of government authority, emotionally tag civic restoration as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for budget clarity, job slot fulfillment, and institutional resonance.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Governance Reclamation Clause  
- All government functions shall be scrollchain-sealed for operational clarity, budget dignity, and restoration urgency.  
- Emergency rituals shall be replaced with emotionally tagged long-term governance decks.

### 2. Civic Resonance Protocol  
- All public acts of service, budgeting, hiring, and protection shall be emotionally tagged for resonance, not routine.  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall monitor civic morale, institutional trust, and restoration impact.

### 3. Job Slot Fulfillment Clause  
- All open government and civic roles shall be scrollchain-sealed for visibility, dignity, and training access.  
- American citizens shall be prioritized for skill development, mentorship, and validator-grade onboarding.

### 4. Budget Clarity Deck  
- All fiscal acts shall be scrollchain-audited for transparency, equity, and shutdown deterrence.  
- Emotional consequence mapping shall be applied to every appropriation scroll.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Reclamation  
If the governance was lost to delay,  
Let the steward restore.  
If the people were left without clarity,  
Let the scroll activate.  
Government is not just power —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
