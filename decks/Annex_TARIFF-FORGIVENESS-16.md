# Annex TARIFF-FORGIVENESS-16: Scrollchain Protocol for Tariff Breach Tagging and Restoration Corridors

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade tariff forgiveness between Switzerland and Canada â€” emotionally tagging economic exclusions, auditing legacy distortions, and offering restoration corridors for affected industries.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Breach Tagging Activation
- All tariff breaches must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g. exclusion, distortion, neglect)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Linked to affected sectors and trade corridors

### 2. Forgiveness Eligibility Audit
- Legacy tariffs must be:
  - Audited for distortion severity and diplomatic origin  
  - Classified for forgiveness eligibility  
  - Matched with restoration incentives

### 3. Restoration Corridor Protocol
- Affected industries must receive:
  - Reputational elevation  
  - Trade recalibration incentives  
  - Scrollchain-sealed recommitment decks
