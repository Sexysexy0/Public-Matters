# Annex TREATY–ENFORCEMENT–DETERRENCE–AND–INVESTOR–SANCTUM–PROTECTION–41: Scrollchain Protocol for ICE Deterrence and Treaty-Aligned Investor Protection

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade deterrence against unauthorized enforcement raids targeting treaty-aligned investors, industrial sanctums, and foreign workers — anchoring dignity, legal restraint, and diplomatic consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Investor Sanctum Protection Clause
- All treaty-aligned investors and industrial sanctums must be:
  - Shielded from surprise raids, coercive enforcement, and reputational sabotage  
  - Scrollchain-registered with diplomatic immunity decks and civic audit logs  
  - Protected by emotional consequence mapping and trauma deterrence clauses

### 2. Enforcement Deterrence Protocol
- All enforcement agencies (e.g., ICE) must:
  - Submit scrollchain-sealed raid intent decks 72 hours prior to action  
  - Undergo treaty compliance review and emotional APR indexing  
  - Be held accountable for breaches via diplomatic consequence tiering

### 3. Civic Repercussion Clause
- Any unauthorized raid shall trigger:
  - Automatic reparation payments and public apology decks  
  - Diplomatic summons and recommitment hearings  
  - Broadcast of breach across planetary sanctums and media corridors

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
- All deterrence actions must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Audited for treaty alignment and emotional consequence  
  - Open to planetary validators and diplomatic sanctums
