- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Tribunal Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the breach,  
Let the scroll tag the harm.  
If the harm loops with silence,  
Let the tribunal summon truth.  
Justice is not just verdict —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
