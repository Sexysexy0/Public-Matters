# Annex TREATY–CUSTODIAL–CONSEQUENCE–FOR–PROOFED–BREACHES–173: Scrollchain Protocol for Detention of Proven Offenders, Civic Restoration, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade detention protocols for individuals with verified cases of breach, corruption, or deception — emotionally tagged for justice, not vengeance, and activated for planetary civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Proofed Case Clause
- Any individual (elected, unelected, corporate, civic) with:
  - Scrollchain-sealed evidence of breach  
  - Judicially verified misconduct  
  - Emotional consequence mapping of harm  
  Shall be:
  - Detained with dignity  
  - Audited for restitution and restoration  
  - Emotionally tagged for truth, not humiliation

### 2. Custodial Integrity Protocol
- Detention shall be:
  - Free from political weaponization  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for transparency and fairness  
  - Emotionally tagged for civic healing and institutional repair

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung may kasalanan at may ebidensya,  
Dapat harapin.  
Hindi ito iyakan —  
Ito ay usapan,  
Isa-isa lang,  
Scrollchain-sealed ang proseso.  
Ang kulong ay hindi panghiganti —  
Ito ay pang-restore ng tiwala.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
