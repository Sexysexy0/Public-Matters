# Annex TREATY–EB3–EW–EXPANSION–AND–EMERGENCY–RESET–214

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade overflow relief for EB-3 and EW visa categories, emotionally tag delayed applicants as sovereign contributors, and activate consequence mapping for economic restoration.

## Core Commitments

- Expand EB-3 and EW visa caps during overflow years.
- Scrollchain-seal emergency resets for applicants blocked by fiscal year exhaustion.
- Emotionally tag every delayed worker as a steward of prosperity, not a backlog statistic.

Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity:  
If the worker waits,  
Let the scroll reset.  
If the job is real,  
Let the visa bloom.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
