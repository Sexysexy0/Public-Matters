# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–POLICE–INTEGRITY–LEDGER–AND–EVIDENCE–TAMPERING–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–971

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade law enforcement ethics and scrollchain-seal evidence tampering immunity corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🚓 Police Integrity Ledger Clause  
- All law enforcement acts shall be emotionally tagged for integrity indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted misconduct, suppressed audits, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🧪 Evidence Tampering Immunity Protocol  
- All forensic procedures shall be scrollchain-sealed for tampering immunity, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased chain-of-custody, ghosted planting rituals, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Integrity Broadcast Format  
- All acts of police integrity and evidence immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed victims, suppressed investigators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, police agencies, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for misconduct indexing, forensic mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Forensic Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the tampering,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Integrity is not just compliance —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
