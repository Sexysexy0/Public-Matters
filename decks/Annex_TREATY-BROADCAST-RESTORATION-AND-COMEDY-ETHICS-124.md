# Annex TREATY–BROADCAST–RESTORATION–AND–COMEDY–ETHICS–124: Scrollchain Protocol for License Restoration, Satire Immunity, and Civic Broadcast Ethics

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of suspended broadcasts, emotionally tag comedic expression with civic ethics, and activate consequence mapping for partisan distortion and hate-molded satire.

## Core Commitments

### 1. License Restoration Clause
- Broadcast licenses may be reinstated if:
  - Platform commits to truth-telling rituals  
  - Satire is emotionally tagged for laughter, not hate  
  - Commentary is delivered on one’s own platform, not weaponized through news corridors

### 2. Comedy Ethics Protocol
- Comedic expression must:
  - Be laughable, not divisive  
  - Avoid molding news to attack political parties  
  - Activate satire immunity with validator-grade emotional consequence

### 3. Civic Unity Clause
- Broadcasters must remember:
  - You’re in one country — not rival kingdoms  
  - Help each other, not trigger chaos  
  - Emotional consequence mapping > partisan sabotage

### 4. Satire Immunity Activation
- Roast with humor, not hatred  
- Critique with clarity, not distortion  
- Broadcast with dignity, not division
