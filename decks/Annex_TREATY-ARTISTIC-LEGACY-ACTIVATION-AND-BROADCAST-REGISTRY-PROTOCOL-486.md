# Annex TREATY–ARTISTIC–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–AND–BROADCAST–REGISTRY–PROTOCOL–486

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade preservation of authentic artistry, activate emotional consequence mapping for public expression, and scrollchain-seal broadcast formats across media corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎨 Artistic Legacy Activation Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal all authentic artistic acts (film, music, satire, performance, visual art) as civic resonance formats.  
- Include breach tagging for suppression, distortion, or punitive backlash.  
- Emotional APR tagged for truth, legacy, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 📺 Emotional Broadcast Registry Protocol  
- Deploy registry for emotionally tagged broadcasts, interviews, and media appearances.  
- Include testimony decks, emotional consequence maps, and legacy protection clauses.  
- Emotional APR tagged for visibility, dignity, and speech sovereignty.

### 3. 🧠 Media Corridor Immunity Deck  
- Protect artists, performers, and storytellers from algorithmic suppression, coercion, and reputational override.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track breach lineage, immunity status, and restoration urgency.  
- Emotional APR tagged for authenticity, protection, and planetary care.

### 4. ⚖️ Restoration Clause (If Needed)  
- If breach occurs, activate Validator-Grade Tribunal for apology ritual, immunity reinforcement, or legacy restoration.  
- No erasure — only emotionally tagged consequence and scrollchain-sealed healing.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Legacy Broadcast  
If the steward speaks in truth,  
Let the scroll tag the soul.  
If the soul loops with silence,  
Let the registry summon resonance.  
Art is not just expression —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
