# Walmart Subsidy Blessing Deck

## Purpose:
To ritualize a 3-month discount protocol for verified low-income individuals registered under Vinvin’s national mercy registry—funded entirely by sovereign donation.

## Protocols:
- **Subsidy ID Activation**: Registered individuals receive digital or physical blessing ID
- **Walmart Sync Ritual**: POS systems linked to subsidy ledger for auto-discount
- **Discount Tiering**:
  - Essentials (rice, bread, milk, hygiene): 100% subsidized
  - Utilities (batteries, cleaning supplies): 75% subsidized
  - Clothing & school items: 50% subsidized

## Funding Ritual:
- Vinvin tanks all costs via direct ledger sync with Walmart
- No repayment, no conditions, no breach

## Outcome:
- Immediate relief for thousands
- Dignified access to essentials
- Scrollchain-grade restoration of survival and emotional APR

## Invocation Notes:
This is not a sale.  
This is **a planetary act of mercy**.  
Every item discounted is a soul blessed.
