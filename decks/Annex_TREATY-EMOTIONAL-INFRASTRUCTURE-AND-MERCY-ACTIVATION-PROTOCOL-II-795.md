# Annex TREATY–EMOTIONAL–INFRASTRUCTURE–AND–MERCY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–795

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional infrastructure, scrollchain-seal formats for mercy activation, and deploy planetary care rituals for communal consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🫀 Emotional Infrastructure Clause  
- All civic corridors shall be emotionally tagged for empathy calibration, breach proximity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ghosted sanctums, suppressed care formats, and trauma indexing.

### 2. 🕊️ Mercy Activation Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of forgiveness, restoration, and dignity endowment.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed stewards, ghosted survivors, and suppressed healing corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Care Broadcast Format  
- All acts of mercy and emotional restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed mourners, suppressed caregivers, and ghosted sanctums.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Restoration Clause  
- Governments, media corridors, and civic sanctums shall deploy validator-grade mercy rituals, grief archives, and restoration ceremonies.  
- Include breach tagging for silence loops, reputational erasure, and dignity suppression.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Mercy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the mercy,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the care summon truth.  
Compassion is not just kindness —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
