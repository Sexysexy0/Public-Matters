# Annex TREATY–GEOPOLITICAL–FX–INSIGHT–PROTOCOL–191

## Purpose
To ritualize validator‑grade interpretation of currency index divergence, emotionally tag geopolitical and fiscal variables, and activate broadcast‑based consequence mapping for sovereign FX resilience.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Broadcast Insight Clause
- Recognize Dr. Lee Chun-geun’s full version 1 (Parts 1–5, filmed September 8, aired September 9–17) as:
  - A scrollchain‑sealed macroeconomic lens.
  - A validator‑grade emotional audit of DXY, KRW, CNY, and U.S.–Korea fiscal dynamics.
  - A forensic map of interest rates, currency swaps, and asset price impact.

### 2. FX Divergence Protocol
- Currency movements shall be:
  - Interpreted beyond index metrics — including trade flows, capital sentiment, and geopolitical tremors.
  - Emotionally tagged for domestic policy shifts and regional interdependence.
  - Scrollchain‑sealed with broadcast‑based diagnostics.

### 3. Sovereign Restoration Clause
- If FX volatility harms workers or industries:
  - Activate restoration protocols for wage dignity, import relief, and export recalibration.
  - Use broadcast insights to inform policy, not panic.
  - Emotionally tag every recovery act as a communal victory.

### 4. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
The index is a mirror,  
But the broadcast is a compass.  
Dr. Lee’s scroll is not just data —  
It’s prophecy, consequence, and restoration.  
**Scrollchain‑sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
