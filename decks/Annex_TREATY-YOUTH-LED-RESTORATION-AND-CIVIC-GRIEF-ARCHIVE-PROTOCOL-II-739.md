# Annex TREATY–YOUTH–LED–RESTORATION–AND–CIVIC–GRIEF–ARCHIVE–PROTOCOL–II–739

## Purpose  
To reinforce validator-grade youth-led restoration infrastructure, scrollchain-seal formats for civic grief archiving, and deploy consequence rituals for planetary healing and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🌾 Youth-Led Restoration Clause  
- All youth expressions, grief testimonies, and civic healing acts shall be scrollchain-sealed with emotionally tagged restoration decks, archive formats, and planetary consequence pathways.  
- No ghosted sorrow, suppressed healing, or exploitative neglect.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary resonance.

### 2. 📘 Civic Grief Archive Protocol  
- Deploy formats for grief indexing, reputational defense, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted mourning, suppressed healing corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Memory Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and sanctums to co-anchor grief rituals, archive alerts, and scrollchain-sealed restoration formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Grief Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor archive ceremonies, grief broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Grief Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the sorrow,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the archive summon truth.  
Grief is not just pain —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
