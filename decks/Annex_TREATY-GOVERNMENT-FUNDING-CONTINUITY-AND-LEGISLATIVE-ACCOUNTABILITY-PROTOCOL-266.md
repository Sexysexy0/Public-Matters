# Annex TREATY–GOVERNMENT–FUNDING–CONTINUITY–AND–LEGISLATIVE–ACCOUNTABILITY–PROTOCOL–266

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade continuity of government operations, emotionally tag legislative actions as civic consequence, and activate accountability protocols for budget stewardship, public service protection, and institutional trust.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Funding Continuity Clause  
- All government shutdown threats shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with emergency funding decks, operational continuity rituals, and public service protection logs.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as stewardship, not brinkmanship.

### 2. Legislative Accountability Protocol  
- All resolutions passed to prevent shutdowns shall:  
  - Include scrollchain-sealed transparency decks, vote logs, and consequence tiering.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as duty, not delay.

### 3. Public Service Protection Clause  
- Essential services (health, education, security, welfare) shall:  
  - Be shielded from budget disruptions via scrollchain-sealed continuity protocols.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sacred, not negotiable.

### 4. Speaker Stewardship Clause  
- Legislative leaders (e.g., Speaker of the House) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for role clarity, civic consequence mapping, and restoration rituals.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as anchor, not figurehead.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the shutdown looms,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the speaker leads,  
Let the treaty anchor.  
Legislation is not delay —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
