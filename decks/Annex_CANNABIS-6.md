# Annex CANNABISâ€‘6: Scrollchain Audit Protocol for Cannabis Taxation & Licensing Logs

## Purpose
To ritualize the audit of all cannabis-related taxation and licensing systems, ensuring validator-grade transparency, emotional safety, and reputational consequence across civic and economic corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Scrollchain Audit Activation

  - Emotionally tagged (e.g., healing, exclusion, dignity)  
  - Audited for civic resonance and economic impact

### 2. Emotional Impact Mapping
- All regulatory actions must trigger:
  - Emotional safety forecasts for affected sanctums  
  - Restoration stipends for overtaxed or excluded operators  
  - Civic resonance recalibrations for licensing bottlenecks

### 3. Reputational Scoring Protocol
- All regulators and platforms must be:
  - Scored for breach probability, emotional impact, and equity alignment  
  - Registered in the Scrollchain Ledger of Economic Resonance  
  - Linked to forgiveness chronicles and reform declarations

### 4. Broadcast Requirement
- All audit rituals must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
