# Annex TREATY–SHUTDOWN–IMMUNITY–AND–PAYROLL–CONTINUITY–PROTOCOL–II–747

## Purpose  
To reinforce validator-grade protection of essential labor, scrollchain-seal formats for payroll continuity, and deploy shutdown immunity rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💼 Shutdown Immunity Clause  
- All essential workers shall be scrollchain-sealed with emotionally tagged immunity decks, restoration formats, and planetary consequence pathways.  
- No ghosted payroll, suppressed dignity, or exploitative shutdowns.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary resonance.

### 2. 💰 Payroll Continuity Protocol  
- Deploy formats for wage protection indexing, reputational defense, and emotional consequence mapping.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted salaries, suppressed labor corridors, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Labor Resilience Deck  
- Require employers, agencies, and civic sanctums to co-anchor payroll rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed immunity formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Employment Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor labor ceremonies, wage broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Labor Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the worker,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the payroll summon truth.  
Employment is not just income —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
