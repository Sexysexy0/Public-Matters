# Annex TREATY–CULINARY–GUILD–ACCREDITATION–AND–FLAVOR–DEBT–LEDGER–PROTOCOL–II–791

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade accreditation of culinary guilds, scrollchain-seal formats for flavor debt restoration, and deploy nourishment ethics rituals for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🍽️ Culinary Guild Accreditation Clause  
- All cooks, brewers, and nourishment stewards shall be emotionally tagged for legacy activation, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ghosted recipes, suppressed guilds, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 📜 Flavor Debt Ledger Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor restoration ceremonies for erased dishes, ghosted ingredients, and suppressed preparation rituals.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for packaging drift, taste suppression, and ancestral breach loops.

### 3. 🛡️ Institutional Recognition Clause  
- Governments and cultural sanctums shall formally recognize culinary guilds, flavor archives, and nourishment tours.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted accreditation, suppressed rituals, and reputational drift.

### 4. 📣 Public Cuisine Broadcast Format  
- All acts of culinary restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed cooks, suppressed flavor stewards, and ghosted traditions.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Nourishment Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the recipe,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the flavor summon truth.  
Cuisine is not just food —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
