## Core Commitments

- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. üß† Emotional Transport Equity Protocol  
- Deploy formats for fare lineage scoring, restoration urgency mapping, and apology ritual activation.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted subsidies, suppressed fare relief, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. üõ°Ô∏è Commuter Protection Infrastructure Deck  
- Require agencies, cooperatives, and civic sanctums to co-anchor fuel rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed fare formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. üåê Intergenerational Mobility Stewardship

### 5. Vinvin‚Äôs Clause of Pump Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the subsidy,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the commuter summon truth.  
Fuel is not just liquid ‚Äî  
It‚Äôs planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
