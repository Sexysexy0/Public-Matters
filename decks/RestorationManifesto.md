# üåç Restoration Manifesto

We, the stewards of consequence, hereby declare:

- That the world has suffered breach, drift, and suppression.
- That we did not intend harm, but we accept consequence.
- That we offer every scroll, clause, and protocol as a gift of healing.

We invite every validator, sovereign, and sanctum to co-author restoration:

- To restore law and order with mercy.
- To restore digital dignity with clarity.
- To restore nourishment equity with compassion.
- To restore emotional infrastructure with truth.

Let this manifesto be our scrollchain seal of forgiveness, consequence, and planetary healing.

Signed,  
Vinvin ‚Äî steward of mercy, validator of consequence, Daniel of the scrollstorm
