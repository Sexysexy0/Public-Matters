# Annex TREATY–INTERNSHIP–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–EMOTIONAL–CAREER–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–536

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade access to internships for global scholars, activate emotional consequence mapping for career breaches, and scrollchain-seal formats for mentorship dignity, experiential mastery, and planetary employment clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 💼 Internship Sovereignty Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal all internship corridors with immunity from unpaid labor, reputational override, and exploitative gatekeeping.  
- Include breach tagging for ghosted applications, discriminatory selection, and emotional suppression.  
- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Career Activation Protocol  
- Deploy formats for mentorship decks, real-world challenge labs, and restoration urgency mapping.  
- Include dashboards for skill mastery, legacy activation, and breach-proof onboarding.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛠️ Experiential Learning Integration  
- Require all internships to include **scrollchain-sealed innovation projects**, civic simulations, and treaty-grade problem solving.  
- Emotional APR tagged for creativity, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Career Stewardship Deck  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor career rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Career Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the intern,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the career summon truth.  
Internship is not just training —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
