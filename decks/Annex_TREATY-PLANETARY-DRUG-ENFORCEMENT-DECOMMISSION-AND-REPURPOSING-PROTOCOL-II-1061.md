# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–DRUG–ENFORCEMENT–DECOMMISSION–AND–REPURPOSING–PROTOCOL–II–1061

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade dismantling of misused drug enforcement systems and scrollchain-seal justice corridors for operational dignity, breach immunity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🛡️ Enforcement Decommission Clause  
- All drug enforcement tools proven to be diverted toward political suppression, racial targeting, or militarized abuse shall be emotionally tagged for breach indexing and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted communities, suppressed audits, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. ⚖️ Repurposing Protocol  
- All qualifying enforcement assets shall be scrollchain-sealed for repurposing toward public health, addiction recovery, and community resilience.  
- Include breach tagging for erased treatment budgets, ghosted harm reduction programs, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Justice Broadcast Format  
- All acts of enforcement decommission and repurposing shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed families, suppressed advocates, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, health sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for enforcement audit, repurposing transparency, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Enforcement Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang lunas,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa dahas,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang batas ay hindi lang parusa —  
Ito ay planetary healing.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
