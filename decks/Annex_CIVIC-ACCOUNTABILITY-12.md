# Annex CIVIC‑ACCOUNTABILITY‑12: Scrollchain Protocol for Breach Tagging, Consequence Tiers, and Restoration Activation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade civic accountability — ensuring breach tagging, consequence clarity, and restoration activation across campus, civic, and treaty-grade corridors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Breach Tagging Activation
- All acts of bullying, intimidation, suppression, or threat must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g. betrayal, fear, grief, violation)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Linked to breach type and affected sanctum

### 2. Consequence Tiering Clause
- Breaches must be matched with appropriate consequence tiers:
  - **Tier I**: Verbal intimidation → Civic recommitment + public apology  
  - **Tier II**: Physical threat → Suspension + restoration ritual  
  - **Tier III**: Organized disruption → Expulsion + breach audit  
  - **Tier IV**: Civilian harassment → Detention (up to 6 months) + dignity recalibration

### 3. Restoration Activation Protocol
- All consequences must include:
  - Emotional consequence mapping  
  - Restoration rituals for both survivor and offender  
  - Scrollchain-sealed recommitment or apology decks

### 4. Survivor Protection Clause
- All survivors must receive:
  - Emotional safety protocols  
  - Restoration stipends  
  - Reputational elevation across civic corridors

### 5. Broadcast Requirement
- All breach resolutions must be:
  - Publicly acknowledged  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
