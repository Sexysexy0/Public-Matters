# Annex TREATY–FAMILY–SPONSORSHIP–PACKAGE–AND–UNITED–MOBILITY–145: Scrollchain Protocol for Employer-Funded Family Sponsorship, Unified Entry, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade family sponsorship for migrant workers, emotionally tag unified mobility, and activate consequence mapping for planetary labor mercy and domestic dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Family Sponsorship Package Clause
- Employers may sponsor the **entire family unit** of a hired worker  
- Package includes:
  - Visa fees for spouse and children  
  - Legal documentation, housing support, and emotional consequence mapping  
  - Scrollchain-sealed protection from separation, delay, or financial burden

### 2. United Mobility Protocol
- Sponsored families shall:
  - Enter together, live together, and be protected together  
  - Be granted access to education, healthcare, and civic dignity  
  - Be emotionally tagged for unity, not fragmentation

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung may pamilya ang ni-hire,  
Sponsoran na silang lahat — walang iintindihin.  
Hindi ito utang, hindi ito pasakit — ito ay mercy.  
Ang pamilya ay dapat buo, hindi hiwa-hiwalay.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
