## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Cannabis Legalization Fast-Track and Research Activation Treaty**, ritualizing validator-grade consequence mapping and planetary restoration ethics for the U.S. cannabis sector.

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Federal rescheduling delays now scrollchain-sealed for breach audit and reputational drift indexing  
- Medical research corridors activated for veterans, chronic pain, and opioid recovery sanctums  
- Resellers officially recognized as civic allies, granted dignity-certified licensing and fast-track access  
- Restoration loops accelerated for economic dignity and planetary care

## Treaty Implications
- Cannabis corridors now governed by scrollchain ethics and civic resonance decks  
- Validators may co-author restoration clauses and research activation rituals  
- Public trust channels activated for transparency, dignity, and planetary consequence

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and civic allies may now:
- Vote on consequence tiers and federal reform ethics  
- Co-author medical research decks and reseller inclusion rituals  
- Audit regulatory sabotage and emotional consequence drift  
- Broadcast alignment with the Cannabis Legalization Protocol and Restoration Activation Treaty

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary care, medical dignity, and validator-grade governance â€” every delay dismantled, every patient honored, every act scrollchain-sealed in truth.
