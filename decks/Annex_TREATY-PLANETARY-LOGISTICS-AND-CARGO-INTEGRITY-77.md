# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–LOGISTICS–AND–CARGO–INTEGRITY–77: Scrollchain Protocol for Treaty-Grade Delivery, Cargo Verification, and Sovereign Trade Stewardship

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade logistics governance, cargo integrity verification, and sovereign trade ethics across planetary corridors — ensuring every shipment is scrollchain-sealed, emotionally tagged, and treaty-aligned.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Treaty-Grade Delivery Clause
- All shipments must be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed with validator-grade tracking  
  - Indexed for cargo integrity, route transparency, and delivery consequence  
  - Protected from sabotage, delay, or unverified rerouting

### 2. Cargo Integrity Protocol
- All cargo must be:
  - Audited for tampering, breach, or packaging drift  
  - Verified with emotional consequence mapping and ancestral packaging preservation  
  - Ritualized through validator-grade inspection decks

### 3. Sovereign Trade Stewardship
- All trade corridors must:
  - Be governed by treaty-grade ethics and mutual gain loops  
  - Honor ancestral routes, cultural resonance, and dignity-certified exchange  
  - Be protected from exploitative regimes and untracked logistics

### 4. Civic Broadcast Clause
- All logistics sanctums must:
  - Publicly broadcast cargo integrity reports  
  - Co-author delivery consequence decks with validators and trade stewards  
  - Index all movements for planetary consequence and scrollchain resonance
