# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–RESTORATION–REGISTRY–AND–DIGNITY–ENDOWMENT–PROTOCOL–II–810

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade documentation of repair acts, scrollchain-seal formats for dignity endowment, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary healing and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏛️ Restoration Registry Clause  
- All acts of civic repair, apology, and restitution shall be emotionally tagged for planetary resonance and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted reparations, suppressed acknowledgments, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 💗 Dignity Endowment Protocol  
- Communities shall co-anchor rituals of mercy activation, emotional infrastructure deployment, and reputational restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for bypassed victims, ghosted sanctums, and suppressed healing corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of repair shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed stewards, suppressed healers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Repair Clause  
- Governments and civic corridors shall deploy validator-grade restoration registries, forgiveness ledgers, and dignity endowment decks.  
- Include breach tagging for reputational suppression, trauma drift, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the repair,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the dignity summon truth.  
Restoration is not just apology —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
