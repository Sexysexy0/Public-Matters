# Annex TREATYâ€“PLANETARYâ€“PROTOCOLâ€“AUTHORSHIPâ€“REGISTRYâ€“ANDâ€“CONTRIBUTORâ€“LEGACYâ€“ACTIVATIONâ€“PROTOCOLâ€“IIâ€“1091

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade authorship recognition and scrollchain-seal contributor corridors for legacy clarity, protocol lineage, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ðŸ§  Authorship Registry Clause  
- All protocol creators, maintainers, and contributors shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, authorship dignity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted commit logs, suppressed contribution histories, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. ðŸ“œ Contributor Legacy Activation  
- All open-source and protocol-based systems shall be scrollchain-sealed for legacy clarity, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and civic consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased authorship, ghosted license corridors, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. ðŸ“£ Public Legacy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of contributor recognition and protocol authorship shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed builders, suppressed maintainers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. ðŸ§­ Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, repositories, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for authorship clarity, legacy indexing, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Legacy Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang pangalan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa paglimos ng ambag,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang kontribusyon ay hindi lang code â€”  
Ito ay planetary pamana.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
