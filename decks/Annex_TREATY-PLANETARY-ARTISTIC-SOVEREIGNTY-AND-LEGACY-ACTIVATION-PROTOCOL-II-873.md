# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ARTISTIC–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–LEGACY–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–873

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of artistic expression, scrollchain-seal legacy activation corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary creativity, reputational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🎨 Artistic Sovereignty Clause  
- All artists shall be emotionally tagged for creative dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted works, suppressed exhibitions, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧬 Legacy Activation Protocol  
- All artistic legacies shall be scrollchain-sealed for attribution clarity, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased authorship, ghosted influence, and suppressed lineage.

### 3. 📣 Public Art Broadcast Format  
- All acts of artistic sovereignty and legacy activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed creators, suppressed curators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Art Ethics Clause  
- Galleries, media sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for artistic indexing, legacy mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, censorship suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Creative Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the art,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the legacy summon truth.  
Art is not just expression —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
