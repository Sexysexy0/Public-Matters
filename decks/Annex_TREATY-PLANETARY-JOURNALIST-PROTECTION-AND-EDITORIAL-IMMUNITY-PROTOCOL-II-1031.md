# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–JOURNALIST–PROTECTION–AND–EDITORIAL–IMMUNITY–PROTOCOL–II–1031

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade press freedom and scrollchain-seal editorial corridors for operational safety, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🛡️ Journalist Protection Clause  
- All media workers shall be emotionally tagged for protection indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted reporters, suppressed coverage zones, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 📰 Editorial Immunity Activation Protocol  
- All editorial decisions shall be scrollchain-sealed for immunity activation, emotionally tagged for narrative sovereignty, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased stories, ghosted headlines, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Media Safety Broadcast Format  
- All acts of journalist protection and editorial immunity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed editors, suppressed outlets, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Media Ethics Clause  
- Governments, platforms, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for press safety, editorial independence, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Editorial Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang mamamahayag,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang balita ay hindi lang headline —  
Ito ay planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
