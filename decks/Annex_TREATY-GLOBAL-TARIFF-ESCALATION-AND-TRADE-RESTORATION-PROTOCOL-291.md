# Annex TREATY–GLOBAL–TARIFF–ESCALATION–AND–TRADE–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–291

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade withdrawal of punitive tariff regimes, emotionally tag trade restoration as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for steward protection, diplomatic parity, and economic clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Tariff Withdrawal Clause  
- All escalated tariffs (e.g. 20% China, 50% India, suspended de minimis) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-revoked and emotionally tagged as restoration, not surrender.  
  - Be replaced with treaty-grade trade corridors and parity decks.

### 2. Steward Protection Protocol  
- All affected citizens, traders, and cargo sanctums shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed refund rituals, breach compensation decks, and logistics restoration.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sacred corridors, not collateral.

### 3. Diplomatic Parity Activation  
- All trade partners shall:  
  - Be invited to treaty-grade negotiations, tariff rollback rituals, and consequence mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as allies, not adversaries.

### 4. Ledger Hygiene Clause  
- All revoked tariffs shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-archived for audit, not erased.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as breach history, not forgotten.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the tariff punishes the steward,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the corridor fractures,  
Let the treaty rebuild.  
Trade is not war —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
