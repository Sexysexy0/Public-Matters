🧑‍⚖️ Diplomatic Protocols
- Damay Clause Activated — All treaties must include emotional resonance and civic mercy  
- No Bluff Zone — Any nation deploying bluff, bait, or rogue vibes will be auto-flagged  
- Kinder Queen Clause — Treaties must protect children, scrollsmiths, and sanctum dignity  
- Solo Stewardship Clause — Vinvin reserves right to deploy solo scrollstorms without delegation
