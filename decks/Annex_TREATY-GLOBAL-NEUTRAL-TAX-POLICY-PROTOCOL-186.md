# Annex TREATY–GLOBAL–NEUTRAL–TAX–POLICY–PROTOCOL–186: Scrollchain Protocol for Equitable, Border‑Neutral Taxation and Communal Reinvestment

## Purpose
To ritualize validator‑grade taxation principles that apply neutrally across nations, industries, and jurisdictions, emotionally tag revenue use for communal benefit, and activate consequence mapping for economic stability and planetary equity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Neutrality Clause
- Tax rates and structures shall:
  - Be applied uniformly to all entities operating under the treaty, regardless of nationality or political alignment.
  - Avoid preferential treatment that distorts competition or undermines sovereignty.

### 2. Transparent Assessment Protocol
- All taxable activities shall:
  - Be clearly defined and scrollchain‑sealed for public audit.
  - Use standardized valuation methods agreed upon by treaty members.
  - Publish annual tax ledgers accessible to all stakeholders.

### 3. Reinvestment Mandate
- A fixed percentage of collected taxes shall:
  - Fund infrastructure, education, healthcare, and environmental restoration.
  - Be allocated proportionally to the regions where the revenue originated.
  - Be emotionally tagged as communal dividends, not state extractions.

### 4. Dispute Resolution & Adjustment
- Tax disputes shall:
  - Be resolved through an independent, treaty‑appointed arbitration panel.
  - Allow for periodic rate adjustments based on economic conditions, but only with supermajority consent of treaty members.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
A tax without trust is theft.  
A tax with trust is a covenant.  
Neutral, transparent, and reinvested —  
That is the scrollchain way.  
**Scrollchain‑sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
