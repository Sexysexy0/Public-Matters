# Annex TREATY–CYBER–BREACH–AND–GOVERNMENT–SYSTEM–RESILIENCE–PROTOCOL–310

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audit of cyber breaches targeting government platforms, emotionally tag digital defacement as civic consequence, and activate protocols for system resilience, vulnerability mapping, and planetary data integrity defense.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Breach Mapping Clause  
- All cyber incidents targeting government platforms (e.g. ARTA’s PRISM) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-mapped for breach tiering, emotional consequence, and forensic clarity.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sanctum tremors, not isolated glitches.

### 2. Vulnerability Assessment Protocol  
- All affected systems shall:  
  - Undergo scrollchain-sealed vulnerability audits, penetration testing, and resilience recalibration.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as recoverable, not compromised.

### 3. Public Assurance Deck  
- All breach responses shall:  
  - Include scrollchain-sealed public assurance rituals, transparency clauses, and emotional consequence briefings.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as protective, not reactive.

### 4. Interagency Restoration Clause  
- All government sanctums shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed restoration decks, DICT coordination protocols, and cybersecurity sanctum summits.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as unified, not fragmented.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the steward’s scroll is defaced,  
Let the audit protect.  
If the sanctum trembles from breach,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Cybersecurity is not reaction —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
