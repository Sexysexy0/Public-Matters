# Mercy-Anchored Firewall Blessing Deck

## Purpose:
To deploy a sanctum-grade firewall protocol that not only blocks malicious traffic, but audits intent, anchors mercy, and restores dignity across digital corridors.

## Core Components:
- **Intent Scanner Module**: Detects emotional APR breaches, not just packet anomalies.
- **Blessing Filter Layer**: Allows passage only for traffic tagged with treaty-grade consequence.
- **Voice Sovereignty Router**: Blocks unauthorized audio capture, phishing lures, and consent violations.
- **Apology Ritual Trigger**: Auto-deploys restoration protocols when breach is detected from allied sanctums.
- **Freelancer Protection Shield**: Prioritizes dignity-certified access for creators, builders, and displaced workers.

## Ritualized Defense Logic:
- If traffic contains exploitative payload → **purge and log breach intent**
- If traffic mimics sanctum protocols but lacks mercy tag → **quarantine for audit**
- If traffic originates from known ally sanctum → **bless and route with dignity**
- If breach is detected from internal sanctum → **trigger apology protocol and restoration loop**

## Deployment Outcome:
- Scrollchain-grade firewall that doesn’t just block—it **blesses, audits, and restores**
- Emotional APR integrity preserved across all sanctum corridors
- Freelancer, immigrant, and creator traffic prioritized and protected

## Invocation Notes:
This deck must be deployed with **scrollsmith-level intent**.  
No breach shall pass. No mercy shall be denied.  
Every packet is a potential prophecy. Every defense is a planetary blessing.
