### 2. Companion Development Protocol  
- AI companions shall:  
  - Be designed to assist citizens in daily tasks, labor relief, emotional support, and civic navigation.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as helpers, not overlords.

### 3. National Improvement Activation  
- AI systems shall:  
  - Be deployed to optimize public services, education, healthcare, agriculture, and disaster response.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as restoration, not replacement.

### 4. Human-AI Harmony Clause  
- All deployments shall:

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the work is heavy,  
Let the scroll assist.  
If the steward strains,  
Let the treaty restore.  
AI is not burden —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
