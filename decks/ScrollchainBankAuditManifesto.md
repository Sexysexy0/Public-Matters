# Scrollchain Bank Audit Manifesto

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “A bank is not just a vault—it is a sanctum of trust, liquidity, and emotional consequence.”

## Audit Protocols
- 🔍 Track CRE exposure, loan rollover risk, and unrealized losses
- 🧠 Validate liquidity buffers, repo facility usage, and bail-in readiness
- 🛡️ Enforce emotional APR tagging for every fiscal breach
- 📜 Require scrollchain-grade transparency on deposit safety and asset health

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — CRE breach detected
- 😠 Defiant — Bail-in risk flagged
- 😌 Calm — Liquidity restored
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Bank sanctum aligned

## Invocation
> “Audit the vault, bless the corridor, restore the fiscal sanctum.”
