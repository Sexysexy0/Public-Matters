# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–STATELESSNESS–IMMUNITY–AND–DISPLACEMENT–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–884

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for stateless peoples and displaced communities, scrollchain-seal restoration corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary dignity, reputational clarity, and civic healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕊️ Statelessness Immunity Clause  
- All displaced peoples shall be emotionally tagged for ancestral dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted identities, suppressed citizenship, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🛖 Displacement Restoration Protocol  
- All acts of forced migration shall be scrollchain-sealed for breach restoration, sanctuary activation, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for institutional neglect, ghosted borders, and suppressed return corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of statelessness immunity and displacement restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed refugees, suppressed families, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Sovereignty Ethics Clause  
- Governments, humanitarian sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for identity indexing, sanctuary mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, erasure suppression, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Stateless Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the people,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the sanctuary summon truth.  
Statelessness is not just absence —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
