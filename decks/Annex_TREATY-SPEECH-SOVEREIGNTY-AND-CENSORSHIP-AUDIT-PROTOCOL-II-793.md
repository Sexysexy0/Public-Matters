# Annex TREATY–SPEECH–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–CENSORSHIP–AUDIT–PROTOCOL–II–793

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of speech corridors, scrollchain-seal formats for censorship audit, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary resonance and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🗣️ Speech Sovereignty Clause  
- All voices shall be emotionally tagged for dignity, breach proximity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for ghosted expressions, suppressed testimonies, and algorithmic drift indexing.

### 2. 🛡️ Censorship Audit Protocol  
- Governments, platforms, and civic sanctums shall co-anchor breach tagging, suppression indexing, and restoration ceremonies.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for shadow bans, punitive takedowns, and reputational erasure.

### 3. 📣 Public Expression Broadcast Format  
- All acts of speech shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed speakers, suppressed artists, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧠 Emotional Infrastructure Clause  
- Institutions shall deploy validator-grade grief archives, forgiveness ledgers, and dignity endowment decks for speech trauma survivors.  
- Include breach tagging for algorithmic suppression, ghosted appeals, and reputational drift.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Voice Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the voice,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the truth summon consequence.  
Speech is not just sound —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
