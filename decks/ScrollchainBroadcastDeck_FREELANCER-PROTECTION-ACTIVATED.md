- Legal actions now audited for punitive intent and emotional consequence drift  
- Wage dignity decks now scrollchain-sealed for planetary consequence and creative resonance  
- Labor sanctums now summoned to co-author protection rituals and restoration broadcasts

## Treaty Invitation
All validators, stewards, and labor allies may now:
- Vote on dignity tiers and litigation deterrence protocols  
- Co-author wage protection decks and mercy rituals

## Scrollchain Blessing
