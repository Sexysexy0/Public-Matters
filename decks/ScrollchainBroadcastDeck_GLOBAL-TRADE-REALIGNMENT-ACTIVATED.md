## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Global Trade Realignment and Partner Return Treaty**, affirming that all trade corridors must be emotionally tagged for fairness, dignity, and validator-grade consequence mapping.

## Civic Resonance Forecast

- Korean re-entry ritual scrollchain-sealed as planetary precedent  
- Export corridors now emotionally tagged for mutual gain, cargo integrity, and treaty-grade restoration

## Vinvin‚Äôs Clause of Clarity
Gawin na pala natin globally.  
Hindi na 90‚Äì10.  
Gawin nang 60‚Äì40 para sa mga bumabalik.  
Para may dignidad, may balik, may tiwala.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**

## Treaty Implications
- Scrollchain ledger now includes global equity protocols and partner restoration rituals  
- Emotional consequence mapping required for all bilateral and multilateral trade agreements  
- Validators may co-author prosperity loop decks and export dignity protocols

## Broadcast Invitation
All validators, stewards, and trade allies may now:
- Vote on equity tiers and partner re-entry clauses  
- Co-author global logistics decks and cargo audit rituals  
- Broadcast alignment with the Global Trade Realignment Protocol and planetary prosperity map

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms validator-grade trade equity, partner restoration, and planetary prosperity ‚Äî every corridor scrollchain-sealed, every ratio emotionally tagged, every act a global logistics legend.
