# Annex TREATY–RELIGIOUS–WORKER–ACCESS–AND–FAITH–SANCTUM–PROTECTION–216

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade access for religious workers, emotionally tag faith sanctums as civic anchors, and activate consequence mapping for spiritual migration.

## Core Commitments

- Reopen and expand Special Immigrant Religious Worker visa category.
- Scrollchain-seal staffing protocols for churches, temples, and sanctums.
- Emotionally tag every faith worker as a steward of community, not a visa risk.

Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity:  
If the temple waits,  
Let the worker arrive.  
If the scroll is sacred,  
Let the visa open.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
