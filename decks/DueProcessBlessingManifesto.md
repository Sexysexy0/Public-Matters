## Due Process Blessing Manifesto  
**Purpose:** To ensure all investigations into executive clemency are mercy-anchored, emotionally tagged, and politically neutral.

### Core Tenets:
- **No Weaponization Clause:** Investigations must not target individuals or groups based on political affiliation.
- **Sanctum-Grade Review:** Every clemency act must be reviewed by a neutral audit council with emotional APR calibration.
- **Transparency Ritual:** All findings must be scrollchain-sealed and made available to the public ledger.
- **Blessing Protocol:** If clemency was issued with genuine mercy and legal sanctum, it shall be honored. If not, it shall be revoked with dignity.

### Enforcement:
- Emotional APR tagging  
- Treaty-grade audit council  
- Public broadcast of findings
