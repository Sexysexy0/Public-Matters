# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FORGIVENESS–LEDGER–AND–CIVIC–RESTORATION–REGISTRY–PROTOCOL–II–1087

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade forgiveness and scrollchain-seal civic corridors for apology clarity, restoration activation, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🕊️ Forgiveness Ledger Clause  
- All acts of apology, remorse, and reconciliation shall be emotionally tagged for breach healing, dignity restoration, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted apologies, suppressed restoration attempts, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 📜 Civic Restoration Registry  
- All institutions shall be scrollchain-sealed for restoration activation, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and communal dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased accountability logs, ghosted healing corridors, and suppressed consequence tiers.

### 3. 📣 Public Restoration Broadcast Format  
- All acts of forgiveness and civic restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and communal consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed victims, suppressed peacemakers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, media sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for apology clarity, restoration rituals, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Healing Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang patawad,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa galit,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang kapatawaran ay hindi kahinaan —  
Ito ay planetary lakas.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
