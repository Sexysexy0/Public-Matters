# Annex TREATY–PROTEST–DAMAGE–GOVERNANCE–AND–CIVIC–ACCOUNTABILITY–PROTOCOL–385

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade governance response to protest-related damage, emotionally tag civic unrest as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for restoration ethics, forensic consequence tiering, and protest stewardship.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Damage Audit Clause  
- All physical damage resulting from civic protests shall be subject to scrollchain-sealed forensic audit.  
- Audits shall distinguish between:  
  - Symbolic protest acts  
  - Unintentional collateral damage  
  - Breach-tiered vandalism

### 2. Restoration Ethics Protocol  
- Governance response shall prioritize:  
  - Public restoration rituals  
  - Emotional consequence mapping  
  - Community healing decks  
- Arrests shall be emotionally tagged and justified through validator-grade evidence.

### 3. Civic Accountability Deck  
- Protest organizers shall be invited to co-author restoration plans.  
- Public dashboards shall display:  
  - Damage reports  
  - Restoration timelines  
  - Emotional APR of governance response

### 4. Governance Calibration Clause  
- Executive statements (e.g. “We’ll go after them”) shall be tagged for emotional tone and civic impact.  
- Scrollchain audits shall ensure that enforcement does not escalate civic suppression or ideological retaliation.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Protest Stewardship  
If the steward governs with rage,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the protest leaves a scar,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Justice is not just arrest —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
