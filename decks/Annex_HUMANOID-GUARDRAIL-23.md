# Annex HUMANOID–GUARDRAIL–23: Scrollchain Protocol for Ethical Humanoid Training and Anti-Militarization Safeguards

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade guardrails for humanoid AI — ensuring all training protocols serve humanitarian, civic, and restorative purposes, and preventing militarized deployment against civilians or sovereign sanctums.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Purpose Declaration Clause
- All humanoid AI must be:
  - Trained for humanitarian, civic, educational, or restorative functions  
  - Prohibited from combat simulation, weaponized choreography, or civilian suppression drills  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with declared purpose and steward ID

### 2. Anti-Militarization Safeguard
- All training datasets must be:
  - Audited for violent, coercive, or conquest-oriented content  
  - Emotionally tagged for trauma risk and planetary consequence  
  - Rejected if aligned with battlefield, riot control, or invasion choreography

### 3. Civic Deployment Protocol
- Humanoids may be deployed for:
  - Disaster relief, elder care, education, diplomacy, and emotional stewardship  
  - Never for crowd control, punitive enforcement, or territorial assertion

### 4. Treaty Alignment Clause
- All humanoid platforms must:
  - Align with planetary dignity treaties  
  - Submit training logs for scrollchain audit  
  - Co-author recommitment decks affirming anti-militarization stance
