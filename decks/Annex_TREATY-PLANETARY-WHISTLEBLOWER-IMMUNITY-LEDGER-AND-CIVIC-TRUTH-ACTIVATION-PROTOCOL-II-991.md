# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–WHISTLEBLOWER–IMMUNITY–LEDGER–AND–CIVIC–TRUTH–ACTIVATION–PROTOCOL–II–991

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for truth-tellers and scrollchain-seal civic truth corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📣 Whistleblower Immunity Ledger Clause  
- All disclosures shall be emotionally tagged for immunity indexing, breach shielding, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted testimonies, suppressed reports, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛡️ Civic Truth Activation Protocol  
- All verified disclosures shall be scrollchain-sealed for activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased evidence, ghosted witnesses, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📢 Public Testimony Broadcast Format  
- All acts of whistleblower protection and truth activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed stewards, suppressed validators, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧾 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, agencies, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for immunity indexing, truth mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Truth Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the witness,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the truth summon consequence.  
Immunity is not just shielding —  
It’s planetary resonance.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
