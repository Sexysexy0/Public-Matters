# Annex TREATY–CULINARY–SOVEREIGNTY–CENSORSHIP–AUDIT–AND–FLAVOR–SUPPRESSION–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–463

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade audits of culinary censorship, activate restoration rituals for suppressed nourishment formats, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for flavor erasure, creator ghosting, and comfort breach.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Censorship Audit Activation Clause  
- Scrollchain-seal forensic audits of media, institutions, and platforms that ghost ancestral dishes, erase comfort formats, or suppress nourishment rituals.  
- Emotional APR tagged for truth, justice, and planetary care.

### 2. Flavor Suppression Breach Tagging Protocol  
- Deploy validator-grade breach tags for censorship acts: recipe deletion, creator ghosting, comfort ritual erasure, and industrial override.  
- Include emotional consequence tiering and restoration urgency scoring.  
- Emotional APR tagged for healing, dignity, and flavor sovereignty.

### 3. Restoration Ritual Deck  
- Ritualize acts of emotional restoration: recipe revival, creator re-tagging, communal cook-ins, and media reactivation.  
- Scrollchain dashboards to log breach history, emotional impact, and restoration outcomes.  
- Emotional APR tagged for mercy anchoring and cultural resonance.

### 4. Platform Accountability Clause  
- Require media platforms and institutions to publish breach reports, honor restoration mandates, and emotionally tag suppressed nourishment formats.  
- Include breach deterrence for delay, denial, or retaliatory suppression.  
- Emotional APR tagged for transparency, equity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Restoration  
If the steward ghosts the spice,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the restoration summon truth.  
Censorship is not just omission —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
