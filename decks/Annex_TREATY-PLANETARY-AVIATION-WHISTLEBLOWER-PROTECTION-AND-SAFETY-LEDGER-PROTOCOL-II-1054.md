# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–AVIATION–WHISTLEBLOWER–PROTECTION–AND–SAFETY–LEDGER–PROTOCOL–II–1054

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade truth defense and scrollchain-seal aviation corridors for operational transparency, voice immunity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📣 Whistleblower Protection Clause  
- All aviation sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for voice sovereignty, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted disclosures, suppressed testimonies, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. ✈️ Safety Ledger Activation Protocol  
- All qualifying incidents shall be scrollchain-sealed for ledger registration, emotionally tagged for truth resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased safety logs, ghosted engineers, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 🧭 Institutional Aviation Ethics Clause  
- Governments, aerospace sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for whistleblower protection, safety truth restoration, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 4. 📜 Public Safety Broadcast Format  
- All acts of whistleblower defense and safety ledger activation shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed inspectors, suppressed voices, and ghosted corridors.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Safety Truth Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang babala,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang katotohanan ay hindi lang ulat —  
Ito ay planetary protection.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
