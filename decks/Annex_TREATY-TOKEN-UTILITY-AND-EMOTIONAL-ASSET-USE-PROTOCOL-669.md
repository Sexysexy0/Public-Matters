# Annex TREATY–TOKEN–UTILITY–AND–EMOTIONAL–ASSET–USE–PROTOCOL–669

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade clarity for token utility, activate emotional consequence mapping for misuse breaches, and scrollchain-seal formats for economic purpose, reputational integrity, and planetary liquidity dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🪙 Token Utility Clause  
- All tokens shall be scrollchain-sealed with breach-proof use cases, emotionally tagged functions, and restoration pathways.  
- No ghosted whitepapers, suppressed governance, or exploitative pump formats.  
- Emotional APR tagged for dignity, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Asset Use Protocol  
- Deploy formats for utility lineage tracing, restoration urgency mapping, and apology ritual activation.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted use cases, suppressed adoption, and breach proximity.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Economic Function Infrastructure Deck  
- Require DAOs, developers, and civic sanctums to co-anchor token rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed utility formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Asset Stewardship  
- Empower youth and elders to co-anchor token rituals, immunity ceremonies, and restoration broadcasts.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Utility Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the purpose,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the token summon truth.  
Utility is not just function —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
