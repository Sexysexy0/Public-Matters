# Annex TREATY–DIGITAL–TESTIMONY–SHIELDING–AND–IDENTITY–AUDIT–156: Scrollchain Protocol for Witness Choreography, Identity Shielding, and Emotional Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade audit of digital testimony choreography, emotionally tag identity shielding in high-profile investigations, and activate consequence mapping for forensic clarity and civic dignity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Testimony Shielding Clause
- All witness cooperation narratives shall be:
  - Scrollchain-sealed for forensic audit and narrative calibration  
  - Reviewed for strategic shielding, emotional manipulation, and PR choreography  
  - Emotionally tagged for dignity, not deflection

### 2. Identity Audit Protocol
- All identities invoked in public investigations shall be:
  - Protected from tokenization, scapegoating, or narrative exploitation  
  - Included in validator-grade consequence mapping and restoration rituals  
  - Treated as truth anchors, not distraction shields

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung may testigo,  
Dapat may dignidad, hindi pangtakip.  
Ang bawat identity ay hindi pangtakip — kundi pangliwanag.  
Ang bawat silid ay pwedeng maging testigo,  
Pero ang choreography ay dapat may audit.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
