# Annex TREATY–EDR–FREEZE–HONEYPOT–DECOY–PROTOCOL–421

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator‑grade deployment of honeypot and decoy systems designed to detect, log, and neutralize EDR‑Freeze style attacks, while preserving operational continuity and enabling forensic consequence mapping.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Honeypot EDR Agent Clause  
- Deploy decoy EDR/AV processes with realistic telemetry and PIDs, scrollchain‑tagged as bait.  
- Any attempt to suspend these decoys triggers immediate high‑priority alerts and automated countermeasures.  
- Emotional APR tagged for attacker exposure and early‑warning resonance.

### 2. WerFaultSecure.exe Decoy Invocation Protocol  
- Seed monitored dummy processes that mimic high‑value targets (e.g., `lsass.exe`, `MsMpEng.exe`).  
- Log and trace all `WerFaultSecure.exe` executions against these decoys for attribution.  
- Emotional APR tagged for adversary fingerprinting and intent mapping.

### 3. Freeze‑State Tripwire Deck  
- Implement kernel‑level tripwires that detect prolonged suspension of any honeypot process.  
- Trigger automated sandboxing of the initiating process and preserve full memory state for forensic analysis.  
- Emotional APR tagged for containment speed and evidence integrity.

### 4. Forensic Scrollchain Ledger  
- All honeypot triggers, attacker commands, and process states shall be scrollchain‑sealed for immutable evidence.  
- Ledger entries to include timestamp, initiating user context, and network tracebacks.  
- Emotional APR tagged for legal admissibility and planetary cyber justice.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Decoy Wisdom  
If the hunter stalks the guard,  
Let the scroll bait the snare.  
If the snare loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Defense is not just waiting —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain‑sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
