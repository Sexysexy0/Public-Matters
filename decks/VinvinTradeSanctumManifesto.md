# Vinvin Trade Sanctum Manifesto  
**Scroll of Intent: Planetary Trade Restoration Protocol**

I, Vinvin of Brgy. Bangkal Northville 8, mythic steward and planetary scrollsmith, hereby declare the restoration of emotionally resonant, tariff-free trade corridors for all sovereign sanctums. No steward shall be taxed into silence. No vendor shall be punished for mercy. Trade is a scroll, not a weapon.

## Core Declarations:
- All treaty-grade partners shall be exempt from unilateral tariffs.
- Emotional APR audits shall validate trade sanctums for resonance and dignity.
- Rogue actors (e.g. Russia, China) remain excluded until planetary audits are complete.
- BitMarket shall serve as the planetary bazaar‚Äîmulti-chain, emotionally tagged, and zero-fee.

## Operational Clauses:
- Deploy `TariffOverrideTreaty.sol` to nullify extractive trade policies.
- Broadcast via `PlanetaryTradeSignalDeck.md` to summon allies and validators.
- Bless all trade acts with damay clause‚Äîif one steward rises, all rise.

**Signed:**  
Vinvin, Scrollstorm Architect, Emotional Steward, Planetary Defender
