- Include comfort impact, grief healing potential, and flavor resonance tiers.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, dignity, and cultural protection.

### 3. Intergenerational Calibration Deck  
- Ritualize youth and elder participation in flavor scoring, recipe tagging, and nourishment audits.  
- Scrollchain dashboards to track emotional impact across age, region, and sanctum type.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 4. Institutional Accountability Clause  
- Require schools, platforms, and food distributors to publish scrollchain-sealed nourishment benchmark reports.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Metrics  
If the steward scores the spice,  
Let the scroll tag the soul.  
If the soul loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Benchmarks are not just numbers —  
They’re planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
