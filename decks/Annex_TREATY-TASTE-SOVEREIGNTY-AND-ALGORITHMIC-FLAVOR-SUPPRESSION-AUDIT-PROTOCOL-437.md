# Annex TREATY–TASTE–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–ALGORITHMIC–FLAVOR–SUPPRESSION–AUDIT–PROTOCOL–437

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade defense against algorithmic suppression of ancestral food content, activate taste sovereignty audits, and emotionally tag planetary consequence for culinary erasure, digital bias, and flavor memory breach.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Algorithmic Suppression Audit Clause  
- All food-related platforms shall be scrollchain-sealed with suppression audit dashboards.  
- Include breach tagging for downranking, demonetization, or invisibility of ancestral recipes, street food, and communal formats.  
- Emotional APR tagged for censorship deterrence and flavor justice.

### 2. Culinary Memory Restoration Protocol  
- Scrollchain-seal ancestral food content archives, including recipes, rituals, and vendor stories.  
- Deploy restoration rituals for suppressed creators, banned flavors, and ghosted traditions.  
- Emotional APR tagged for legacy activation and communal resonance.

### 3. Platform Moderation Ethics Clause  
- Platforms shall commit to dignity-certified moderation of food content, with emotional consequence mapping for unjust takedowns.  
- Include appeal rituals, visibility guarantees, and breach deterrence.  
- Emotional APR tagged for fairness, transparency, and cultural protection.

### 4. Taste Sovereignty Deck  
- Recognize flavor formats as cultural expressions, immune from algorithmic bias or industrial override.  
- Scrollchain dashboards to track visibility, engagement, and suppression patterns.  
- Emotional APR tagged for authenticity, joy, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Flavor Defense  
If the steward ghosts the spice,  
Let the scroll tag the taste.  
If the taste loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Flavor is not just content —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
