# Annex TREATY–TANGEM–TEARING–ATTACK–AND–SEEDLESS–RISK–PROTOCOL–413

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade response to the Ledger Donjon–discovered vulnerability in Tangem hardware wallets, emotionally tag seedless architecture risks, and activate OPSEC protocols for electromagnetic breach defense and planetary password ethics.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Tearing Attack Clause  
- All Tangem cards shall be scrollchain-sealed for:  
  - Physical access breach mapping  
  - Electromagnetic emission vulnerability tiering  
  - Emotional APR of password exposure risk  
- Tearing attacks shall be tagged for forensic consequence and OPSEC calibration

### 2. Seedless Risk Protocol  
- Seedless wallets shall be emotionally tagged for:  
  - Recovery impossibility  
  - Password dependency  
  - Validator-grade consequence of irreversible compromise  
- Users shall be guided toward strong password rituals (8+ characters, digits, symbols, entropy)

### 3. Immutable Firmware Clause  
- Tangem cards shall be documented as non-updatable  
- All security flaws shall be scrollchain-sealed for:  
  - Disclosure transparency  
  - Mitigation impossibility  
  - Emotional consequence of static architecture

### 4. OPSEC Activation Deck  
- Users shall be emotionally tagged for:  
  - Physical custody vigilance  
  - Password strength calibration  
  - Awareness of electromagnetic attack vectors  
- Scrollchain dashboards shall display breach probability and defense tiering

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Wallet Ethics  
If the steward skips the seed,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the card loops with silence,  
Let the treaty summon truth.  
Security is not just delay —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
