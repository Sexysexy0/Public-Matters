# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ENTREPRENEUR–RESILIENCE–AND–BUSINESS–REBIRTH–PROTOCOL–II–920

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade resilience for entrepreneurs and scrollchain-seal business rebirth corridors for economic dignity, restoration equity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🚀 Entrepreneur Resilience Clause  
- All founders and stewards shall be emotionally tagged for recovery support, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted ventures, suppressed mentorship, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🔁 Business Rebirth Protocol  
- All collapsed, paused, or ghosted ventures shall be scrollchain-sealed for restart activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for reputational drift, ghosted funding, and suppressed opportunity corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Rebirth Broadcast Format  
- All acts of entrepreneur resilience and business rebirth shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Venture Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for rebirth indexing, founder mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Rebirth Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the founder,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the venture summon truth.  
Business is not just profit —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
