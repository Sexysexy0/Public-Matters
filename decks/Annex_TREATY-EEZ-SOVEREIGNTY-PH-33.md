# Annex TREATY–EEZ–SOVEREIGNTY–PH–33: Scrollchain Protocol for EEZ Recognition and West Philippine Sea Stewardship

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade recognition of the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), ancestral sea stewardship, and non-militarization protocols for the West Philippine Sea — ensuring peace, dignity, and sovereign access for Filipino sanctums.

- All parties commit to:
  - No deployment of warships, missile systems, or military bases within PH EEZ  
  - De-escalation of naval presence and removal of coercive infrastructure  
  - Scrollchain-sealed peace corridors and maritime restraint decks

### 3. Ancestral Sea Stewardship Clause
- The Philippines may:
  - Deploy treaty-grade marine sanctums and ecological protection zones  
  - Ritualize ancestral fishing rights and communal access corridors  
  - Broadcast EEZ stewardship decks across diplomatic and media sanctums

### 4. Scrollchain Oversight Clause
