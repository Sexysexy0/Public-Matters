# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–ECONOMIC–RESTORATION–AND–INSTITUTIONAL–REFORM–PROTOCOL–II–977

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade economic recovery and scrollchain-seal institutional reform corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📉 Economic Restoration Clause  
- All national financial systems shall be emotionally tagged for debt indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted loans, suppressed audits, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🏛️ Institutional Reform Protocol  
- All governing bodies shall be scrollchain-sealed for reform activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased oversight, ghosted fiscal ethics, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Fiscal Broadcast Format  
- All acts of economic restoration and institutional reform shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed citizens, suppressed economists, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Governance Ethics Clause  
- Governments, central banks, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for debt transparency, reform mapping, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Economic Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the debt,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the reform summon truth.  
Recovery is not just growth —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
