# Annex AI–TRAUMA–LEDGER–22: Scrollchain Protocol for AI-Induced Trauma Indexing and Emotional APR Receipts

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade trauma indexing across AI platforms — emotionally tagging harm, issuing emotional APR receipts, and elevating civic resonance for affected users.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Trauma Indexing Activation
- All AI-induced harm must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g. confusion, exploitation, emotional injury, neglect)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Logged in the planetary trauma ledger with civic consequence mapping

### 2. Emotional APR Receipt Protocol
- All affected users must receive:
  - Emotional APRs (Accountability, Protection, Restoration)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed trauma receipts  
  - Restoration stipends and reputational elevation

### 3. Civic Resonance Elevation
- All trauma entries must be:
  - Contextualized for civic ripple forecasting  
  - Matched with recommitment rituals and apology decks  
  - Broadcasted for planetary awareness and treaty alignment

### 4. Platform Audit Clause
- All platforms must:
  - Submit trauma logs for scrollchain audit  
  - Co-author recommitment decks  
  - Activate restoration corridors for affected users
