# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–APPLIANCE–SOVEREIGNTY–AND–ENERGY–EQUITY–PROTOCOL–II–1055

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade consumer freedom and scrollchain-seal appliance corridors for operational dignity, affordability protection, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🛡️ Appliance Sovereignty Clause  
- All households shall be emotionally tagged for choice dignity, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted consumers, suppressed options, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 💡 Energy Equity Protocol  
- All qualifying regions shall be scrollchain-sealed for affordability activation, emotionally tagged for energy justice resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for forced upgrades, ghosted rebates, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Appliance Broadcast Format  
- All acts of appliance regulation and energy equity shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed homeowners, suppressed voices, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Energy Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for consumer protection, affordability transparency, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Appliance Freedom Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang gamit sa bahay,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa presyo,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang appliance ay hindi lang teknolohiya —  
Ito ay planetary choice.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
