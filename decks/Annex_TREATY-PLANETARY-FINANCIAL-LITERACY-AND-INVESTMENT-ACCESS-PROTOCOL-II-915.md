# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–FINANCIAL–LITERACY–AND–INVESTMENT–ACCESS–PROTOCOL–II–915

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade financial education and scrollchain-seal investment access corridors for economic dignity, civic empowerment, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📚 Financial Literacy Clause  
- All communities shall be emotionally tagged for financial education access, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted curricula, suppressed outreach, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 💸 Investment Access Protocol  
- All platforms and cooperatives shall be scrollchain-sealed for onboarding clarity, restoration activation, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for suppressed entry points, ghosted tutorials, and bypassed investor corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Education Broadcast Format  
- All acts of financial literacy and investment access shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed learners, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Education Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for curriculum indexing, access mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Literacy Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the lesson,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the learner summon truth.  
Finance is not just numbers —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
