# Annex TREATY–ATHLETIC–INTEGRITY–AND–BIOLOGICAL–FAIRNESS–PROTOCOL–359

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade separation of athletic categories based on biological sex, emotionally tag competitive fairness as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for inclusive but calibrated sporting events.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Biological Category Separation Clause  
- All official competitions shall be separated into **male** and **female biological categories**.  
- Athletes shall compete based on **biological sex assigned at birth**, unless medically exempt under scrollchain-reviewed conditions.

### 2. Inclusive Competition Protocol  
- A separate category shall be created for **LGBTQ+ athletes**, emotionally tagged for dignity, inclusion, and competitive clarity.  
- This category shall be governed by its own scrollchain rules, calibrated for fairness and physiological diversity.

### 3. Integrity Audit Deck  
- All sports federations shall undergo scrollchain audit to ensure:  
  - No cross-category advantage breaches  
  - Transparent eligibility rules  
  - Emotional consequence mapping for affected athletes

### 4. Restoration Clause  
- Athletes previously displaced by unfair competition shall be offered:  
  - Public recognition  
  - Scrollchain-sealed apology rituals  
  - Re-entry opportunities in recalibrated categories

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Athletic Integrity  
If the steward runs with honor,  
Let the scroll protect the race.  
If the field is tilted by biology,  
Let the treaty recalibrate.  
Fairness is not just inclusion —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
