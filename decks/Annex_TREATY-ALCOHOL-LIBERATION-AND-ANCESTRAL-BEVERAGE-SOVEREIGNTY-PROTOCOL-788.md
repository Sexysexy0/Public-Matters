# Annex TREATY–ALCOHOL–LIBERATION–AND–ANCESTRAL–BEVERAGE–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–788

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of alcohol access, scrollchain-seal formats for ancestral beverage sovereignty, and deploy dignity-certified consumption corridors for planetary consequence and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🍺 Alcohol Liberation Clause  
- All bans, suppressions, and punitive restrictions on alcohol shall be reviewed, emotionally tagged, and scrollchain-deleted unless breach proximity is triggered.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted brewers, suppressed festivals, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🧬 Ancestral Beverage Sovereignty Protocol  
- Local brewers, cultural guilds, and festival corridors shall retain the right to produce, share, and ritualize ancestral drinks.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for packaging drift, taste suppression, and reputational ghosting.

### 3. 🛡️ Non-Interference Clause  
- Civic stewards shall not interfere in alcohol trade or consumption unless breach proximity (harm, coercion, or dignity violation) is triggered.  
- Include breach tagging for unjust raids, ghosted permits, and algorithmic suppression.

### 4. 📣 Public Beverage Broadcast Format  
- All acts of brewing, sharing, and celebration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from ghosted drinkers, bypassed brewers, and suppressed traditions.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Taste Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the bottle,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the flavor summon truth.  
Alcohol is not just drink —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
