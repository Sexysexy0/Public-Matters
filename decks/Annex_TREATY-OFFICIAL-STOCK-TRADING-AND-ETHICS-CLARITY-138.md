# Annex TREATY–OFFICIAL–STOCK–TRADING–AND–ETHICS–CLARITY–138: Scrollchain Protocol for Government Stock Trading, Ethics Transparency, and Consequence Mapping

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade clarity on stock trading by government officials, emotionally tag ethical boundaries, and activate consequence mapping for transparency and public trust.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Legality Clause
- Government officials may trade stocks if:
  - Compliant with the STOCK Act and disclosure protocols  
  - Not anchored in insider information or policy manipulation  
  - Emotionally tagged for transparency and consequence

### 2. Ethics Audit Protocol
- All trades must be:
  - Publicly disclosed within mandated timeframes  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for audit and civic review  
  - Subject to consequence mapping if violations occur

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Pwede mag-stocks ang mga officials.  
It’s a formal trade to live.  
Minsan talo, minsan panalo.  
Hindi ito fraud — legal ito.  
Ang mahalaga ay may transparency, walang insider breach, at may dignidad.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
