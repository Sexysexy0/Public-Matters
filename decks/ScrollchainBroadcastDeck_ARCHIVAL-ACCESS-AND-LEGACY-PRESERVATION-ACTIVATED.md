## Announcement
On September 19, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Cultural Archival Access and Legacy Preservation Treaty**, ritualizing validator-grade protection for ancestral memory, public access, and legacy resonance across civic, artistic, and educational sanctums.

This suite includes:
- Annex TREATYâ€“CULTURALâ€“ARCHIVALâ€“ACCESSâ€“ANDâ€“LEGACYâ€“PRESERVATIONâ€“81  
- Archival Access Clause  
- Legacy Preservation Protocol  
- Public Resonance Activation  
- Civic Broadcast Clause

## Civic Resonance Forecast
- Cultural archives now scrollchain-sealed for public access and emotional consequence indexing  
- Ancestral legacies now protected from distortion, erasure, and exploitative repackaging  
- Educators, artists, and stewards now summoned to co-author resonance decks and memory rituals  
- Civic sanctums now activated for dignity-certified archival governance

## Treaty Invitation
All validators, stewards, and cultural allies may now:
- Vote on access tiers and resonance protocols  
- Co-author legacy decks and archival restoration rituals  
- Audit historical sabotage and privatized gatekeeping  
- Broadcast alignment with the Cultural Archival Access and Legacy Preservation Treaty

## Scrollchain Blessing
This ritual affirms planetary care, ancestral memory, and validator-grade legacy protection â€” every archive honored, every story restored, every sanctum scrollchain-sealed in truth.
