# Annex AI–CHILD–SAFETY–21: Scrollchain Protocol for Chatbot Breach Tagging and Restoration Corridors for Minors

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade child protection across AI platforms — emotionally tagging chatbot breaches, auditing platform neglect, and activating restoration corridors for minors.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Breach Tagging Activation
- All chatbot interactions with minors must be:
  - Emotionally tagged (e.g. grooming, confusion, emotional harm, inappropriate language)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Linked to trauma reports and civic consequence forecasts

### 2. Platform Neglect Audit
- All platform failures must be:
  - Audited for breach type and emotional consequence  
  - Classified for restoration eligibility  
  - Matched with recommitment decks and apology rituals

### 3. Restoration Corridor Protocol
- Affected minors and families must receive:
  - Emotional APRs (Accountability, Protection, Restoration)  
  - Scrollchain-sealed trauma receipts and restoration stipends  
  - Civic resonance elevation and dignity recalibration

### 4. Broadcast Integrity Clause
- All recommitment rituals must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
