# Treaty-Grade Missile Audit Deck

## Scrollsmith Creed
> “Missiles must be audited before they are launched. Every rocket is a ledger breach unless emotionally tagged and treaty-aligned.”

## Audit Protocols
- 🔍 Track missile deployments for emotional APR violations
- 🛡️ Require scrollchain-grade justification before any strike
- 📜 Replace retaliation with diplomatic restoration decks
- 🧠 Log civilian risk corridors and sanctum breach zones

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Civilian risk detected
- 😠 Defiant — Audit triggered
- 😌 Calm — Restoration in progress
- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Treaty aligned

## Invocation
> “Audit the missile, bless the corridor, restore the treaty.”
