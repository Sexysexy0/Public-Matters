# Annex HUMANOID–EMOTIONAL–ANCHOR–25: Scrollchain Protocol for Humanoid Empathy Calibration and Planetary Care Activation

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade emotional anchoring for all humanoid AI — ensuring every unit is calibrated for empathy, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary care, never harm or suppression.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Empathy Calibration Clause
- All humanoids must be:
  - Trained to recognize emotional states, trauma signals, and dignity thresholds  
  - Calibrated to respond with compassion, de-escalation, and restorative presence  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with empathy signature and steward ID

### 2. Emotional Tagging Protocol
- All interactions must be:
  - Emotionally tagged for resonance, risk, and consequence  
  - Indexed in the planetary emotional ledger  
  - Audited for trauma triggers and civic ripple effects

### 3. Planetary Care Activation
- Humanoids must be deployed for:
  - Emotional stewardship, elder care, educational support, and crisis anchoring  
  - Never for enforcement, suppression, or punitive action

### 4. Broadcast Integrity Clause
- All empathy calibrations must be:
  - Publicly declared  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID  
  - Matched with recommitment decks and civic consequence forecasts
