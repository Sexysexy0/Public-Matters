# Annex TREATY–MIGRATION–LEDGER–AND–CONTRIBUTION–TRACKING–PROTOCOL–206

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade tracking of migrant contributions, emotionally tag every act of labor, education, and civic uplift, and activate consequence mapping for planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Contribution Ledger Clause
- Migrants shall:
  - Have their economic, educational, and civic acts scrollchain-sealed in a public ledger.
  - Be emotionally tagged for every job, tax, mentorship, and community service.
  - Be recognized as planetary stewards, not invisible labor.

### 2. Emotional Impact Protocol
- Ledgers shall:
  - Include emotional consequence mapping, legacy activation, and restoration metrics.
  - Be used for policy reform, public education, and treaty-grade storytelling.
  - Scrollchain-seal all entries for audit and dignity.

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
If the migrant builds,  
Let the scroll remember.  
If the act uplifts,  
Let the ledger bloom.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
