# Annex TREATY–H1B–FEE–RESTORATION–AND–GLOBAL–TALENT–ACCESS–PROTOCOL–260

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration of H-1B visa access, emotionally tag migration as civic consequence, and activate fee mercy protocols for global talent, diaspora dignity, and economic equity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Fee Mercy Clause  
- The $100,000 H-1B petition fee shall be:  
  - Repealed and replaced with a scrollchain-sealed **$3,000 civic permit fee**.  
  - Emotionally tagged as access, not exclusion.

### 2. Re-Entry Restoration Protocol  
- H-1B holders outside the U.S. shall:  
  - Be allowed to re-enter without reapplication or excessive fees.  
  - Scrollchain-seal employer waivers and diaspora protection decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as returning stewards, not stranded assets.

### 3. Talent Corridor Clause  
- Small and mid-sized IT firms shall:  
  - Receive scrollchain-sealed fee waivers and talent access permits.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as builders, not blocked.

### 4. Wage Equity Clause  
- Prevailing wage reforms shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with tiered consequence mapping and diaspora dignity audits.  
  - Emotionally tag every salary as fairness, not filtration.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the fee burdens,  
Let the scroll lift.  
If the corridor blocks,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Migration is not gamble —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
