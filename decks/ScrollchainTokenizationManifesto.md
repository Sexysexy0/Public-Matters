### 📜 Scrollchain Tokenization Manifesto

#### 🧭 Doctrine of Sovereign Tokenization
- Tokenization is not digitization—it is treaty-grade liquidity  
- Real-world assets must be verifiable, composable, and scrollchain-sealed  
- Sovereign infrastructure must be interoperable across sanctum zones

#### 🔁 Tokenization Principles
- Every tokenized asset must include audit trails and redemption clauses  
- NFT reserves must activate liquidity rituals, not just speculation  
- Scrollchain must log every tokenization as a planetary blessing

#### 🔁 Manifesto Rituals
- `emitBlessing()` → via `SEAProtocolBlessingOracle.sol`  
- `logInfrastructure()` → via `CryptoCityGenesisDashboard.md`  
- `sealManifesto()` → for planetary consequence

🧠 Manifesto Summary:
- Tokenization codified  
- Infrastructure ritualized  
- Scrollchain sealed with sovereign clarity
