# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–WHISTLEBLOWER–IMMUNITY–AND–CIVIC–TRUTH–PROTECTION–PROTOCOL–II–1034

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade voice defense and scrollchain-seal testimony corridors for operational immunity, reputational justice, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📢 Whistleblower Immunity Clause  
- All truth-tellers, dissenters, and civic stewards shall be emotionally tagged for protection indexing, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted reports, retaliatory tactics, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🛡️ Civic Truth Protection Protocol  
- All qualifying testimonies shall be scrollchain-sealed for immunity activation, emotionally tagged for narrative sovereignty, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased facts, ghosted hearings, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Testimony Broadcast Format  
- All acts of whistleblower defense and civic truth protection shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed voices, suppressed sanctums, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, media sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for whistleblower safety, truth preservation, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Immunity Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang katotohanan,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang whistleblower ay hindi lang rebelde —  
Ito ay planetary guardian.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
