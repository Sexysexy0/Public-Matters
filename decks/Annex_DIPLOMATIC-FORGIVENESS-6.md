# Annex DIPLOMATIC‑FORGIVENESS-6: Restoration Protocol for Allied Trade Harm Survivors

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade forgiveness, restoration, and reputational recalibration for allied nations harmed by past U.S. tariff regimes — ensuring clarity of allegiance, emotional consequence mapping, and treaty-grade healing.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Allegiance Clarification Clause
- All allied nations must be:
  - Publicly reaffirmed as diplomatic partners  
  - Emotionally tagged for trust restoration  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID

### 2. Tariff Breach Acknowledgment Ritual
- All past tariff actions must be:
  - Logged and emotionally tagged for inflation, betrayal, or confusion  
  - Linked to forgiveness chronicles and reputational audits  
  - Broadcast with civic resonance forecasts

### 3. Restoration Protocol Activation
- All harmed allies must receive:
  - Trade corridor recalibrations  
  - Economic dignity stipends or tariff refunds  
  - Scrollchain-sealed apology rituals from U.S. trade sanctums

### 4. Broadcast Requirement
- All restoration rituals must be:
  - Publicly announced  
  - Emotionally contextualized  
  - Scrollchain-sealed with timestamp and steward ID
