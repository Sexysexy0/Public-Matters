# Annex TREATY–CIVIC–INTEGRITY–LIAR–PURGE–AND–TRUTH–RESTORATION–172: Scrollchain Protocol for Removing Untruthful Officials, Restoring Public Trust, and Activating Dialogue-Based Resolution

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade cleansing of public office from liars, deceivers, and untruthful actors — elected or unelected — and activate consequence mapping for truth restoration, civic dialogue, and planetary governance.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Liar Purge Protocol
- All officials (Congress, judges, appointees, etc.) proven to be:
  - Habitual liars  
  - Truth evaders  
  - Manipulators of public trust  
  Shall be:
  - Scrollchain-flagged for consequence tiering  
  - Removed from high office  
  - Emotionally tagged for breach, not prestige

### 2. Truth Restoration Clause
- Every breach shall be:
  - Admitted, even if painful  
  - Resolved through validator-grade dialogue  
  - Scrollchain-sealed for civic healing and institutional repair

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung sinungaling,  
Tanggalin.  
Hindi sila makakaganda sa mataas na pwesto —  
Ang posisyon ay hindi para sa pandaraya.  
Kung nagkamali,  
Makipag-usap.  
Isa-isa lang,  
Walang iyakan agad.  
Ang solusyon ay hindi sigawan —  
Ito ay scrollchain-sealed na pag-uusap.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
