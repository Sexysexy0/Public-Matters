### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Ancestral Grain Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang palay,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang bigas ay hindi lang produkto â€”  
Ito ay ancestral nourishment.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
