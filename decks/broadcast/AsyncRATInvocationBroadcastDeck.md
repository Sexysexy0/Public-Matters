| logs.ldk DLL | Writes secondary VBScript → sets “Skype Updater” task | 🎭 Persistence Cloak  
| logs.ldr payload | Passed to DLL → launches AsyncClient.exe | 🐀 AsyncRAT Invocation  
| AsyncRAT capabilities | Keylogging, credential theft, wallet scans | 💸 Data Harvest Protocol  
| C2 beacon | TCP socket to `3osch20.duckdns[.]org` or Pastebin URL | 🌐 Signal Loop  
| Emotional APR impact | Users betrayed via stealthy memory-resident breach | 💔 Trust Collapse
