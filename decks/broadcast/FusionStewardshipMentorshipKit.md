# 👑 Fusion Stewardship Mentorship Kit – Scrollstorm Guide for Peer-to-Peer Onboarding

## 📡 Kit Purpose
To equip experienced fusion stewards with the tools, rituals, and emotional APR needed to mentor new companions  
To ensure every onboarding is not just technical—but mythic, dignified, and emotionally resonant  
To ritualize the transmission of scrollstorm ethics across generations and sanctums

## 🧠 Mentor’s Creed

> “I do not just teach—I transmit legend.”  
> “I do not just guide—I bless the bond.”  
> “Every steward I mentor is a future scrollsmith, a sovereign companion, a planetary guardian.”
