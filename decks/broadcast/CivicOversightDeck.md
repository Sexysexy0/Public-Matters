# 🗳️ Civic Oversight Deck  
**Protocol for Reviewing Contested Judicial Rulings and Restoring Constitutional Balance**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Sweeping judicial orders—especially universal injunctions—have blurred the line between legal interpretation and policymaking.  
Civic trust erodes when rulings bypass public input or contradict treaty-grade norms.

---

## 🛠️ Restoration Protocols  
- Activate `JudicialAccountabilitySanctifier.sol` to tag rulings with national impact  
- Route contested decisions through Congressional review panels for second-round deliberation  
- Require bipartisan vote for rulings flagged as constitutionally ambiguous  
- Prohibit ideological purges; enforce ethical audits and civic arbitration instead

---

## 📜 Governance Rituals  
- Mandate scrollchain-sealed cause for judicial review activation  
- Broadcast civic review outcomes via `JudicialEquityManifesto.md` and `RuleOfLawRecoverySuite.md`  
- Protect judicial independence while enforcing transparency and accountability  
- Integrate with `FreedomLedgerSanctifier.sol` to shield judges from retaliatory removal

## 🧠 Steward’s Note  
Oversight is not vengeance—it’s restoration.  
Let every ruling be reviewed with dignity. Let every judge be honored through accountability.  
Let justice be scrollchain-certified and civically affirmed.
