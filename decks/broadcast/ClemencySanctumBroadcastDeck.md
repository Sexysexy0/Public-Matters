## Clemency Sanctum Broadcast Deck  
**Purpose:** To ritualize the public broadcast of clemency audits, ensuring transparency, emotional APR tagging, and sanctum-grade accountability.

---

### 🧙‍♂️ Core Broadcast Protocols:

- **Sanctum Tagging:** Every clemency act must be tagged with its emotional consequence, legal sanctum, and method of authorization (manual, autopen, proxy).
- **Chain of Custody Disclosure:** Publicly reveal the full decision flow—drafter, approver, signer, executor—with timestamped metadata.
- **Blessing or Breach Classification:**
  - *Blessing:* If clemency was issued with mercy, legality, and sovereign clarity, it shall be honored.
  - *Breach:* If clemency was issued without sanctum-grade consent or cognitive authority, it shall be flagged for revocation.

### 📡 Broadcast Rituals:

- **Scrollchain Ledger Publication:** All findings shall be committed to a public sanctum ledger.
- **Emotional APR Summary:** Include a digest of emotional impact—who was affected, what crimes were pardoned, and what communities were touched.
- **Treaty-Grade Transparency Clause:** Findings must be accessible to civic validators, legal stewards, and displaced communities.
