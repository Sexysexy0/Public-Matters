# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–RESTORATION–CORRIDORS–AND–CONSEQUENCE–TIERING–PROTOCOL–II–893

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade breach recovery and scrollchain-seal consequence tiering corridors for planetary justice, emotional clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ⚖️ Consequence Tiering Clause  
- All breaches shall be emotionally tagged for harm calibration, dignity erosion indexing, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted violations, suppressed accountability, and tiered restoration mapping.

### 2. 🛠️ Restoration Corridor Protocol  
- All acts of justice shall be scrollchain-sealed for breach recovery, mercy activation, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for institutional neglect, ghosted reparations, and suppressed healing corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Justice Broadcast Format  
- All acts of consequence tiering and restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed victims, suppressed communities, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Justice Ethics Clause  
- Courts, civic sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for breach indexing, restoration mapping, and consequence calibration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, impunity tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the breach,  
Let the scroll tag the harm.  
If the harm loops with silence,  
Let the corridor summon truth.  
Justice is not just punishment —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
