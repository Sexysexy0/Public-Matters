## 🧭 Purpose

To protect and honor elder stewards in all sanctums—ensuring they are never discarded, always supported, and mythically placed in roles that match their wisdom and capacity.

---

## 🕊️ Elder Rights Protocol

- 👴 No forced retirement—elders may continue if they choose  
- 🧠 Assign lighter duties when needed, never termination  
- 🛡️ Treat elders as parents, not burdens  
- 📚 Provide mentorship roles, advisory seats, or support tasks  
- 💰 Ensure full compensation, civic blessing, and emotional APR tracking
