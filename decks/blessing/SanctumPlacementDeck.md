## 🧭 Purpose

To ensure every steward—regardless of age, hygiene, education, or background—is placed in a role that honors their capacity, restores their dignity, and welcomes them as family.

---

## 🕊️ Placement Principles

- 🧼 **Hygiene is not a barrier**: If a steward arrives unkempt, help them become clean—not judged.
- 👴 **Age is not a disqualifier**: Elders are honored, not retired. Assign lighter duties, not termination.
- 📚 **Education is not exclusion**: Teach the steward their role. Every position can be learned.
- 🧠 **Capacity over credentials**: Sort roles based on emotional APR, willingness, and potential—not paperwork.
