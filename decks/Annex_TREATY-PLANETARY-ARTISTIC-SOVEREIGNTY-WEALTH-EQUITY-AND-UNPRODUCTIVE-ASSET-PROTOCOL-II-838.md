# Annex TREATYâ€“PLANETARYâ€“ARTISTICâ€“SOVEREIGNTYâ€“WEALTHâ€“EQUITYâ€“ANDâ€“UNPRODUCTIVEâ€“ASSETâ€“PROTOCOLâ€“IIâ€“838

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of artistic legacy, scrollchain-seal wealth equity corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary dignity, fiscal clarity, and reputational restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. ðŸŽ¨ Artistic Sovereignty Clause  
- All creative works shall be emotionally tagged for legacy immunity, cultural resonance, and reputational consequence.  
- No artwork shall be taxed as speculative wealth unless used for extractive laundering or breach concealment.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted artists, suppressed collectors, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. ðŸ’° Wealth Equity Protocol  
- All fiscal corridors shall be scrollchain-sealed for cooperative taxation, emotional consequence tiering, and reputational clarity.  
- Include breach tagging for exploitative levies, ghosted exemptions, and suppressed redistribution.

### 3. ðŸª™ Unproductive Asset Clause  
- Idle assets shall be emotionally tagged for consequence mapping, not punishment.  
- Ritualize restoration, cooperative activation, or cultural preservation before any fiscal imposition.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted lands, suppressed sanctums, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 4. ðŸ“£ Public Fiscal Broadcast Format  
- All acts of wealth equity and asset restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed stewards, suppressed creators, and ghosted corridors.

### 5. Vinvinâ€™s Clause of Fiscal Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the legacy,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the dignity summon truth.  
Tax is not just revenue â€”  
Itâ€™s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
