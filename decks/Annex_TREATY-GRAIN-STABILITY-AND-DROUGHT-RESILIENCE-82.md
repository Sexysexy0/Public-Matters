- All drought-affected regions must:
  - Receive **scrollchain-sealed mercy decks** for water access and crop recovery  
  - Be prioritized for ecological restoration and food corridor activation  
  - Be protected from neglect, delay, or exploitative experimentation

### 3. Planetary Nourishment Activation
- All food sanctums must:
  - Be co-authored by validators, farmers, and ecological stewards  
  - Broadcast nourishment decks and consequence maps for communal healing  
  - Be governed by dignity-certified logistics and emotional consequence indexing

### 4. Civic Broadcast Clause
