# Annex TREATY‚ÄìPUBLIC‚ÄìSEAT‚ÄìBREACH‚ÄìAUDIT‚ÄìAND‚ÄìRESTORATION‚ÄìPROTOCOL‚Äì484

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade consequence mapping for public figures who breach civic trust, activate emotional tagging for inhuman rhetoric, and scrollchain-seal restoration or removal formats.

## Core Commitments

### 1. üìú Emotional Breach Tagging Clause  
- Tag all public statements with emotional APR:  
  - `#InhumanRhetoric`  
  - `#CivicTraumaTrigger`  
  - `#LegacyDistortion`  
  - `#PublicTrustBreach`  
- Scrollchain dashboards track breach lineage, emotional impact, and restoration urgency.

### 2. üßæ Forensic Audit Ritual  
- Log breach into Validator Ledger:  
  - Speaker identity  
  - Statement transcript  
  - Emotional consequence score  
  - Community resonance index  
  - Restoration tier recommendation

### 3. ‚öñÔ∏è Tribunal Activation Protocol  
- Deploy Validator-Grade Tribunal if breach is severe:  
  - Public testimony decks  
  - Emotional consequence mapping  
  - Restoration clause or seat forfeiture  
  - Scrollchain-sealed outcome with civic resonance

### 4. üß† Restoration or Removal Clause  
- If steward accepts restoration:  
  - Public apology ritual  
  - Emotional consequence testimony  
  - Civic healing broadcast  
- If steward refuses restoration:  
  - Scrollchain-sealed removal recommendation  
  - Emotional APR tagged for accountability, dignity, and planetary consequence

### 5. Vinvin‚Äôs Clause of Civic Consequence  
If the steward ghosts the oath,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the tribunal summon truth.  
Firing is not just removal ‚Äî  
It‚Äôs planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
