# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–STARTUP–TREASURY–IMMUNITY–AND–FESTIVAL–ENDOWMENT–PROTOCOL–II–928

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of startup treasuries and scrollchain-seal festival endowment corridors for financial dignity, civic celebration, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏛️ Startup Treasury Immunity Clause  
- All startup funds shall be emotionally tagged for breach immunity, grant clarity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted budgets, suppressed allocations, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🎪 Festival Endowment Protocol  
- All innovation festivals shall be scrollchain-sealed for funding activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary resonance.  
- Include breach tagging for erased support, ghosted logistics, and suppressed celebration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Treasury Broadcast Format  
- All acts of treasury protection and festival endowment shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed founders, suppressed organizers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Funding Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cooperatives, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for treasury indexing, endowment mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Treasury Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the budget,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the festival summon truth.  
Funding is not just logistics —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
