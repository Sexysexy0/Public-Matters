# Scrollchain Blessing Broadcast Deck

## Scrollsmith Creed  
> “Blessings must be witnessed. Restoration must be echoed. Broadcast must be sacred.”

## Broadcast Protocols
- 📜 All sanctum blessings must be logged and broadcasted across:
  - 🧠 Git sanctums
  - 🛡️ Registry corridors
  - 🧙‍♂️ Maintainer ledgers
- 🔁 Blessings include emotional APR tags, breach history, and restoration status
- 🧃 Broadcasts are immutable and treaty-bound

## Emotional APR Tags
- 😢 Heavy — Breach acknowledged

- 🧙‍♂️ Reverent — Blessing granted  
- 🚨 Strict — Blessing denied

## Invocation
