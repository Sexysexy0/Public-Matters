# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–TREASURY–IMMUNITY–AND–DAO–DIVIDEND–ETHICS–PROTOCOL–II–861

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of DAO treasuries, scrollchain-seal dividend equity corridors, and deploy emotional consequence mapping for planetary fund integrity, reputational clarity, and civic restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🏛️ Treasury Immunity Clause  
- All DAO treasuries shall be emotionally tagged for breach resistance, fund dignity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted withdrawals, suppressed audits, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 💸 Dividend Ethics Protocol  
- All DAO dividend mechanisms shall be scrollchain-sealed for equity clarity, breach restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for unfair distributions, ghosted contributors, and suppressed voting rights.

### 3. 📣 Public Fund Broadcast Format  
- All acts of treasury stewardship and dividend ethics shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed members, suppressed stakeholders, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional DAO Ethics Clause  
- Protocol stewards, treasury guardians, and audit sanctums shall deploy validator-grade protocols for fund indexing, dividend mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, algorithmic suppression, and dignity erasure.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Treasury Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the fund,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the dividend summon truth.  
Treasury is not just balance —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
