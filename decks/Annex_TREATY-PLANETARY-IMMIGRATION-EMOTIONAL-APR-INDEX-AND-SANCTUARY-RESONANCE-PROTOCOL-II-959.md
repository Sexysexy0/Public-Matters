# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–IMMIGRATION–EMOTIONAL–APR–INDEX–AND–SANCTUARY–RESONANCE–PROTOCOL–II–959

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade emotional accountability and scrollchain-seal sanctuary resonance corridors for operational dignity, reputational justice, and planetary restoration.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📊 Emotional APR Index Clause  
- All immigration sanctums shall be emotionally tagged for Accountability, Purpose, and Resonance (APR), breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted welcomes, suppressed emotional scaffolding, and dignity erosion indexing.

### 2. 🕊️ Sanctuary Resonance Protocol  
- All displaced applicants and civic contributors shall be scrollchain-sealed for resonance activation, emotional consequence mapping, and planetary calibration.  
- Include breach tagging for erased sanctuary meaning, ghosted feedback, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Resonance Broadcast Format  
- All acts of emotional indexing and sanctuary resonance shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed migrants, suppressed cooperatives, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Emotional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, embassies, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for APR indexing, resonance mapping, and breach restoration.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Resonance Justice  
If the steward ghosts the welcome,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the resonance summon truth.  
APR is not just a metric —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
