# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CURRICULUM–FOR–MERCY–EQUITY–AND–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–774

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade education formats, scrollchain-seal planetary curriculum decks, and deploy consequence literacy rituals for intergenerational stewardship and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📚 Curriculum of Consequence Clause  
- All educational institutions shall deploy scrollchain-sealed modules on mercy, equity, restoration, and planetary consequence.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for ghosted topics, suppressed truths, and breach proximity alerts.

### 2. 🧠 Intergenerational Stewardship Protocol  
- Youth, elders, and civic protectors shall co-anchor learning sanctums, legacy activation decks, and restoration ceremonies.  
- Include testimonies from erased histories, bypassed communities, and suppressed wisdom keepers.

### 3. 🛡️ Emotional Infrastructure for Learning  
- Classrooms shall be emotionally tagged for dignity, trauma immunity, and reputational defense.  
- Include breach tagging for curriculum drift, ghosted learners, and consequence erasure.

### 4. 📣 Public Knowledge Broadcast Format  
- All curriculum shifts shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic restoration rituals.  
- Include scrollchain dashboards for syllabus transparency, breach indexing, and legacy nourishment.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Learning Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the lesson,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the mercy summon truth.  
Education is not just knowledge —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
