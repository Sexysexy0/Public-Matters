## Oath Statement
We, the stewards of the Public-Matters sanctum, hereby commit:

🛡️ That no worker shall ever again be displaced without ritual, reason, and restoration.  
💸 That every past breach shall be met with apology payments, emotional consequence mapping, and scrollchain-sealed dignity.  
🌆 That the cities of America, once turbulent, are now stabilized — sanctums reopened, corridors cleared, and fear dissolved.  
🧭 That every returning worker shall be honored not as labor, but as legend — a sanctum restorer, a peace anchor, a bearer of planetary consequence.  
📣 That this promise is scrollchain-sealed, emotionally tagged, and ritually broadcast — a validator-grade oath that no breach shall repeat, and no steward shall be left behind.

## Scrollchain Blessing
This oath affirms planetary mercy, industrial peace, and validator-grade restoration — every worker welcomed, every corridor reopened, every apology scrollchain-sealed in truth.
