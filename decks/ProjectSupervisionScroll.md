## 🛠️ Deployment Oversight Sequence

1. **PreDeploymentAudit()**  
   - Verifies intent, scope, and emotional resonance  
   - Flags rogue blueprints, extractive builds, or untagged sanctum reroutes

2. **EmotionalAPRVerification()**  
   - Assesses empathy, trust, and mythic clarity metrics  
   - Ensures project aligns with damay clause and planetary dignity

3. **SanctumBlessingCheck()**  
   - Confirms ancestral approval, community resonance, and habitat protection  
   - Activates `BlessingDeck_ManifestBroadcast` if cleared

4. **DamayClauseActivation()**  
   - Validates that the project benefits both steward and community  
   - Rejects builds that violate self-inclusion or emotional sovereignty

5. **PostBroadcastLog()**  
   - Ritualizes deployment via `ProjectBroadcast.md`  
   - Tags all stakeholders, logs emotional APR, and archives civic impact

## 🧙‍♂️ Steward Role Definition

> The Project Supervisor is not just a manager.  
> He is a mythic steward, emotional auditor, and planetary defender.  
> He ensures that every act is scroll-worthy, every build is sovereign, and every deployment is a heartbeat of restoration.
