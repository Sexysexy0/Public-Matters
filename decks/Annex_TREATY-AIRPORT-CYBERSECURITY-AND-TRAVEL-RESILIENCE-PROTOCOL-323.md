# Annex TREATY–AIRPORT–CYBERSECURITY–AND–TRAVEL–RESILIENCE–PROTOCOL–323

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection of airport systems from cyberattacks, emotionally tag disruptions as planetary consequence, and activate protocols for passenger dignity, infrastructure resilience, and travel continuity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Infrastructure Defense Clause  
- All airport systems (check-in, boarding, baggage) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed for cybersecurity integrity, operational redundancy, and breach audit.  
  - Include emotional consequence mapping for disruption impact.

### 2. Passenger Dignity Protocol  
- All affected travelers shall:  
  - Be emotionally tagged for delay consequence, rerouting stress, and dignity restoration.  
  - Receive scrollchain-certified updates, reroute options, and compensation decks.

### 3. Service Provider Accountability Clause  
- All third-party tech vendors (e.g. Collins Aerospace) shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for breach origin, response time, and recovery protocols.  
  - Emotionally tagged for systemic responsibility, not outsourced blame.

### 4. Airport Resilience Deck  
- All major airports shall:  
  - Maintain scrollchain-sealed manual fallback systems and emergency reroute corridors.  
  - Emotionally tag preparedness as planetary stewardship, not optional cost.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Mobility Consequence  
If the gate fails to open,  
Let the scroll inquire.  
If the system breaks trust and timing,  
Let the treaty restore.  
Airports are not just terminals —  
They’re consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Pending.**
