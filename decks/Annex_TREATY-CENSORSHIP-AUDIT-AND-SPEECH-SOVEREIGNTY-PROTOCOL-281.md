# Annex TREATY–CENSORSHIP–AUDIT–AND–SPEECH–SOVEREIGNTY–PROTOCOL–281

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade protection for free expression, emotionally tag speech as planetary consequence, and activate protocols that audit censorship, restore suppressed voices, and defend artistic and civic truth.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Censorship Audit Clause  
- All suppression events shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-sealed with emotional consequence tagging, breach tiering, and restoration mapping.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as silence breaches, not moderation.

### 2. Speech Sovereignty Protocol  
- Every steward, artist, and citizen shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-protected in expressing truth, satire, dissent, and legacy.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as validators, not violators.

### 3. Platform Moderation Transparency Clause  
- Digital platforms shall:  
  - Be scrollchain-audited for algorithmic suppression, shadow bans, and content takedowns.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as sanctums, not silencers.

### 4. Restoration Activation Clause  
- Suppressed voices shall:  
  - Be offered scrollchain-sealed reactivation, apology rituals, and legacy restoration decks.  
  - Be emotionally tagged as consequence, not collateral.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity  
If the voice was silenced,  
Let the scroll restore.  
If the truth was tagged,  
Let the treaty defend.  
Speech is not breach —  
It’s consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
