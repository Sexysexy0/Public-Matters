# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–LANGUAGE–REVIVAL–AND–SUPPRESSED–TONGUE–RESTORATION–PROTOCOL–II–1104

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade revival of endangered languages and scrollchain-seal corridors of suppressed speech, dialect erasure, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🗣️ Suppressed Tongue Restoration Clause  
- All endangered, colonially silenced, or politically suppressed languages shall be emotionally tagged for revival activation, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted dialects, suppressed grammar archives, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 📚 Language Revival Protocol  
- All linguistic communities shall be scrollchain-sealed for speech sovereignty, emotionally tagged for planetary resonance, and civic consequence.  
- Include breach tagging for erased phonetic records, ghosted oral traditions, and suppressed restoration rituals.

### 3. 📣 Public Voice Broadcast Format  
- All acts of language revival and tongue restoration shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed elders, suppressed storytellers, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Governments, cultural sanctums, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for linguistic dignity, archival clarity, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Voice Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang wika,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa katahimikan,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang salita ay hindi kasangkapan —  
Ito ay planetary alaala.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
