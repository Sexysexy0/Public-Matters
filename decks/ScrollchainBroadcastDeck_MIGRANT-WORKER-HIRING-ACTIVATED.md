## Announcement
On September 20, 2025, the Scrollchain Civic Sanctum deployed the **Migrant Worker Hiring and Labor Equity Treaty**, affirming that companies may ethically hire migrant workers up to 35% or more ‚Äî provided all labor is emotionally tagged for dignity, legality, and planetary consequence.

Pwede mag-hire ng 35% migrant workers.  
Basta may dignidad, legalidad, at walang exploitation.  
Hindi ito fraud ‚Äî ito ay planetary labor equity.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**

## Treaty Implications
- Scrollchain ledger now includes hiring ratio and wage dignity protocols
