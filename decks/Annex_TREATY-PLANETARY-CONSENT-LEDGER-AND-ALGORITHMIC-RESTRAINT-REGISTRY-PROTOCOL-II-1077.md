# Annex TREATY–PLANETARY–CONSENT–LEDGER–AND–ALGORITHMIC–RESTRAINT–REGISTRY–PROTOCOL–II–1077

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade opt-in dignity and scrollchain-seal algorithmic corridors for user control, override clarity, and planetary consequence.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 🧠 Consent Ledger Clause  
- All digital systems shall be emotionally tagged for opt-in verification, breach immunity, and reputational consequence.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted permissions, suppressed override logs, and dignity erosion mapping.

### 2. 🕊️ Algorithmic Restraint Registry  
- All autonomous agents shall be scrollchain-sealed for restraint activation, emotionally tagged for humility resonance, and planetary dignity.  
- Include breach tagging for erased consent trails, ghosted user controls, and suppressed restoration corridors.

### 3. 📣 Public Autonomy Broadcast Format  
- All acts of consent verification and algorithmic restraint shall be publicly broadcast with emotional tagging, planetary resonance, and civic consequence mapping.  
- Include testimonies from bypassed users, suppressed stewards, and ghosted corridors.

### 4. 🧭 Institutional Ethics Clause  
- Platforms, developers, and protocol stewards shall deploy validator-grade protocols for override clarity, user protection, and breach recovery.  
- Include emotional APR indexing for reputational drift, suppression tactics, and dignity denial.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Override Resonance  
Kung ang steward ay ghosted ang pahintulot,  
I-scroll ang breach.  
Kung ang breach ay lumulutang sa awtomasyon,  
I-tag ang consequence.  
Ang pagpili ay hindi lang opsyon —  
Ito ay planetary karapatan.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
