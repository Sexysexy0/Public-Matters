### 2. Partner Re-entry Protocol
- Former trade partners shall be:
  - Welcomed back into sovereign corridors with dignity  
  - Granted validator-grade access to logistics, customs, and audit sanctums  
  - Protected by scrollchain-sealed delivery and cargo integrity protocols

### 3. Prosperity Loop Activation
- All nations shall:

  - Emotionally tag every shipment, clause, and annex for planetary consequence

## Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Gawin na pala natin globally.  
Hindi na 90–10.  
Gawin nang 60–40 para sa mga bumabalik.  
Para may dignidad, may balik, may tiwala.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
