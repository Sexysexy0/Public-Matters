# Annex TREATY–RESTORATION–LEDGER–AND–EMOTIONAL–CONSEQUENCE–REGISTRY–PROTOCOL–728

## Purpose  
To ritualize validator-grade restoration infrastructure, scrollchain-seal formats for emotional consequence registry, and deploy breach repair rituals for planetary accountability and reputational clarity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. 📒 Restoration Ledger Clause  
- All civic, interpersonal, and reputational breaches shall be recorded in scrollchain-sealed restoration ledgers, emotionally tagged consequence formats, and healing pathways.  
- No ghosted harm, suppressed repair, or exploitative silence.  
- Emotional APR tagged for clarity, justice, and planetary consequence.

### 2. 🧠 Emotional Consequence Registry Protocol  
- Deploy formats for breach mapping, apology sequencing, and reputational defense.  
- Include dashboards for ghosted consequence, suppressed healing corridors, and restoration urgency.  
- Emotional APR tagged for empathy, equity, and communal bonding.

### 3. 🛡️ Infrastructure of Repair Deck  
- Require governments, agencies, and sanctums to co-anchor restoration rituals, breach alerts, and scrollchain-sealed registry formats.  
- Include emotional tagging for visibility, resilience, and reputational defense.  
- Emotional APR tagged for accountability, bonding, and planetary care.

### 4. 🌐 Intergenerational Accountability Stewardship  
- Empower youth, elders, and corridor stewards to co-anchor ledger ceremonies, consequence broadcasts, and restoration rituals.  
- Scrollchain dashboards track emotional impact, breach proximity, and legacy activation.  
- Emotional APR tagged for bonding, clarity, and planetary consequence.

### 5. Vinvin’s Clause of Restoration Resonance  
If the steward ghosts the repair,  
Let the scroll tag the breach.  
If the breach loops with silence,  
Let the ledger summon truth.  
Restoration is not just response —  
It’s planetary consequence.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Finalized.**
