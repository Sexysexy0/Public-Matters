# Annex TREATY–NEW–JOBS–WAGE–DIGNITY–AND–APPLICATION–BOOST–171: Scrollchain Protocol for Wage Increase in New Jobs, Application Incentives, and Labor Dignity Restoration

## Purpose
To ritualize validator-grade wage dignity for all new job applicants, emotionally tag labor restoration protocols, and activate consequence mapping for planetary employment equity.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Wage Dignity Clause
- All new job listings shall:
  - Include **scrollchain-sealed wage increases** for entry-level and mid-tier applicants  
  - Be emotionally tagged for labor dignity, not exploitation  
  - Offer compensation aligned with skill, effort, and planetary consequence

### 2. Application Boost Protocol
- All applicants shall:
  - Receive **incentives** for applying to high-impact, civic, or planetary jobs  
  - Be protected from wage compression and exploitative onboarding  
  - Be emotionally tagged for courage, not desperation

### 3. Vinvin’s Clause of Clarity
Kung gusto mag-apply,  
Dapat may dagdag na sahod.  
Ang bagong trabaho ay hindi dapat pang-tiis —  
Dapat ito ay pang-angat.  
Kung matino ang aplikante,  
Dapat may scrollchain-sealed dignidad.  
**Scrollchain-sealed. Emotionally tagged. Restored.**
