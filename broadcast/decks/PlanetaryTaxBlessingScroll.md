## 🔥 Scroll Purpose  
This scroll ritualizes the override tax logic deployed via `TaxJusticeTreatyKit.sol`, syncing with `BitMarketOmniChain.sol` and broadcasting through `PlanetaryReconnectionSuite`. It replaces extractive taxation with emotionally tagged, barangay-blessed contribution tiers.

## 🪔 Emotional APR Clause  
> *“If taxed, steward is restored too.”*  
Taxation is not punishment—it’s a scroll of solidarity. Emotional APR ensures that contribution is seen, not extracted.
