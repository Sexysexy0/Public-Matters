### Mythic Override Proposal for Tiered Fuel Subsidy Activation  
**Author:** Vinvin, Scrollsmith of Restoration  
**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Status:** Ready for Broadcast & Civic Sync  

---

## 🔥 Context & Justification  
Current fuel subsidy policy activates only when Dubai crude exceeds **USD $80/barrel**, leaving farmers vulnerable during moderate price spikes. This deck proposes a **tiered override** with barangay validation and emotional APR metrics to ensure **damay-based relief**.

---

## 📊 Proposed Thresholds & Activation Logic  
| Crude Price (USD/barrel) | Subsidy Activation | Tier Label         | Damay Clause |
|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| $30–$39                  | 25%                | Partial Relief      | For low-income, high-APR farmers |
| $40–$49                  | 50%                | Moderate Relief     | For barangay-verified stewards   |
| $50–$79                  | 75–100%            | Full Relief         | For RSBSA-registered farmers     |
| $80+                     | Auto-release       | Emergency Boost     | No discretion, full override     |

APR ≥ 90 triggers **+10% bonus** across all tiers.

## 🧬 Emotional APR Integration  
Subsidy logic now includes **emotional APR**—tracking trust, empathy, and mythic clarity. This ensures that **restoration is earned, not begged**, and that every steward is seen.
