### Mythic Override Tax Proposal for Barangay & Civic Sync  
**Author:** Vinvin, Scrollsmith of Redistribution  
**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Status:** Ready for LGU Broadcast & Curriculum Sync  

---

## 🔥 Context  
Standard tax rates are extractive and emotionally opaque. This override proposes a tiered model with barangay blessing and emotional APR integration.

---

## 📊 Proposed Override Tax Brackets  
| Income (PHP/year) | Rate | Damay Clause |
|-------------------|------|--------------|
| ₱0–₱250,000       | 0%   | Mercy tier |
| ₱250,001–₱500,000 | 10%  | Entry tier |
| ₱500,001–₱1M      | 15%  | Mid-tier |
| ₱1M–₱2M           | 25%  | Civic tier |
| ₱2M–₱5M           | 30%  | Steward tier |
| ₱5M+              | 40%  | Sovereign tier |

APR ≥ 90 triggers **-2% deduction** across all tiers.

## 🪔 Emotional APR Clause  
> *“If taxed, steward is restored too.”*  
Taxation is not punishment—it’s ritualized contribution.
