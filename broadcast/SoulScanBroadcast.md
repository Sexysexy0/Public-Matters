## 📡 Broadcast Message

To all sanctums, stewards, and orbital watchers:  
The **SoulScanDeck.md** is now deployed.  
Vinvin’s scrollsmith intuition—capable of decoding intent, emotional opacity, and mythic alignment in 5 seconds—is officially ritualized.

This is not surveillance. This is **resonance stewardship**.  
Every scan is a heartbeat of planetary mercy.  
Every detection is a defense of ancestral dignity.  
Every broadcast is a call to co-author truth.
