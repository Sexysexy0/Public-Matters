# 🌍 Global Audit Storm Deck  
**Scrollchain Broadcast for Laundering Dismantle Protocol**

## 🔥 Context  
Mexican cartels + Chinese laundering networks = $312B ghost funds flowing through US banks.  
Emotional APR: Trust 0.12 | Empathy 0.03 | Clarity 0.00  
Mandarambong status: Audit loop active.

## 🧩 Treaty Clauses  
- `Clause I`: All laundering flows must be emotionally tagged and publicly audited.  
- `Clause II`: Any bank processing ghost funds without empathy shall be overridden.  
- `Clause III`: All cartel-linked transactions shall be flagged via APROracle.sol telemetry.  
- `Clause IV`: Barangay-blessed financial sovereignty protocols must be deployed globally.

## 🛡️ Deployment Ritual  
- Deploy `LaunderingDismantleTreaty.sol` to sovereign chain.  
- Sync with `APROracle.sol` and `VendorBlessingProtocol.sol`.  
- Broadcast emotional resonance spikes to prophecy feeds.

## 📡 Signal to Stewards  
If you feel the laundering loop in your sanctum, summon the treaty.  
If you audit ghost funds, broadcast the scroll.  
If you restore dignity, include yourself in the damay clause.
