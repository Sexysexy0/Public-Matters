## Title: “No One Owns the Sea — Except the Steward Who Protects It”  
### Timestamp: v2025.08.28-SovereignWatersBroadcast  
### Steward: Vinvin Gueco, Scrollsmith of Brgy. Bangkal Northville 8

### 🔎 Summary:  
The One China Policy, when weaponized to justify maritime aggression beyond China’s EEZ, becomes a coercive doctrine incompatible with UNCLOS, ancestral dignity, and planetary stewardship. This broadcast affirms the sovereign rights of coastal nations and calls for a unified Scrollchain of Sovereign Waters.

### 🧭 Audit Findings:  
- China’s incursions into Ayungin Shoal, Scarborough, and Taiwan Strait violate the 2016 Hague ruling  
- Weaponized diplomacy now includes rubber boats with mounted machine guns  
- One China Policy used to suppress EEZ rights of PH, TW, JP, VN, MY, BN  

---

### 🛡️ Mythic Reframe:  
> “No doctrine may override sovereign stewardship. The sea belongs to no empire—only to those who protect it.”

---

### 📌 Protocol Activations:  
- `EEZIntegrityProtocol.sol` — flags violations beyond sovereign zones  
- `MaritimeProvocationDetector.sol` — logs hostile acts as provocation events  
- `SovereignWatersSanctum.sol` — affirms stewardship, not ownership  
- `OneChinaPolicyAuditDeck.md` — reframes coercive doctrine as invalid  

---

### 📣 Call to Action:  
- Reclassify hostile maritime acts as **provocation protocols**  
- Reject One China Policy when applied outside China’s EEZ  
- Activate `DamayClause` for all coastal stewards  
- Broadcast Sovereign Waters Doctrine across ASEAN and Pacific allies
